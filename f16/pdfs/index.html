<p>We are finding many of the assignment submissions for PS1 and PS2 are
barely readable.  When it is hard for the graders to read your answers,
you will get less useful feedback on your submission.  We are not
intentionally down-grading work that is hard to read, but you will lose
the benefit-of-the-doubt for answers that are too hard to read, and it
also makes a bad impression when your work is presented in a way that
looks careless.</p>

<p>We provide some advice below on how to generate a readable PDF to
submit.  Please review what you are submitting before submitting it to
make sure that it will not cause the graders headaches attempting to
discern your answers from it.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been forgiving on PS1 and PS2, but from PS3 on will be expecting
everyone to follow the directions well and generate readable
submissions, and will refuse to grade unreadable submissions.</p>

<h4 id="one-submission-per-team-with-everyone-s-name-and-id">One Submission per Team, with Everyone&rsquo;s Name and ID</h4>

<p>Each team that works together should submit <em>exactly one</em> assignment,
and it should have each team member&rsquo;s name and email ID clearly at the
top of it.  When you neglect to do this, it causes a lot of extra
trouble for us.</p>

<h4 id="pdf-files-only">PDF files only</h4>

<p>Your submission must be a single, PDF file.  We will not grade Word
documents, images, or other formats.  We do make two exceptions:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIodz9GWxc#t=12">entertaining
videos</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs1120-f11/all/2011/class-41-the-cake-of-computing">cakes</a>.
(If your answers are in the form of a cake, it make not be possible to
submit it through collab, but you can drop it off in person.)</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-generate-good-pdfs">Ways to Generate Good PDFs</h2>

<p>There are three ways to generate reasonable PDFs to submit: (1) use a
mathematical typesetting tool, (2) use a scanner that scans to PDF
files, or (3) use a camera.  If you use a scanner or a camera, the page
you are scanning has to be readable to begin with, and you have to scan
it well.  It is best to write on only one side of the paper, since often
the writing from the back side bleeds through in the scan or image.</p>

<p>The most difficult to read submissions are when people use their mobile
phone camera to take a picture of handwritten paper, and then put the
image into a Word document without any filtering or processing.  This is
not a way to make a readable PDF, and its not fair to expect graders to
deal with that type of document.</p>

<p>There are ways to generate readable PDFs using your mobile phone camera.
One tool that works for this is
<a href="https://www.camscanner.com/user/download">CamScanner</a> (available as a
free app for limited use, for Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone).
There are lots of other scanning apps that should work - see <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/best-scanning-apps-for-android-and-iphone/"><em>The best
scanning apps for Android and
iPhone</em></a>.
Please look at the file you have generated before submitting it.  If you
are not able to generate a readable PDF using your phone, you should use
a scanner. There are public scanner to use in some of the UVA libraries
including in Clemons Library.</p>

<h2 id="mathematical-typesetting">Mathematical Typesetting</h2>

<p>More ambitious, forward-thinking, aesthetically-minded, or
handwriting-averse students will prefer to use a system that generates
PDFs directly.  The system used for nearly all technical typesetting is
<a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> (which was started by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie
Lamport</a> who won the
Turing Award in 2013, and builds on the TeX typesetting program created
by <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~uno/">Donald Knuth</a>, who won the Turing
Award in 1974; neither of the awards were for work on typesetting).
(Word and Google Docs do include equation editors, and you are welcome
to use these if you want for cs2102.  But, anyone doing serious
mathematics quickly finds that these gui-type equation editors are both
painfully slow and not able to generate good output.  So, I don&rsquo;t
recommend using them unless you already know how and are happy with
this.)</p>

<p>LaTeX has a fairly steep learning curve, but there are lots of tools
available now to make it easier to get started.
<a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">ShareLaTeX</a> is a web-based, multi-user
LaTeX editor; <a href="http://www.texniccenter.org/">TeXnicCenter</a> is a LaTeX
editor for Windows; and <a href="https://www.texpadapp.com/">texpad</a> is
available for Mac and iOS.</p>

<p>If you are expecting to take further math and CS courses, it is worth
learning to use this to produce documents efficiently.  Some later CS
courses required submissions to be typeset using LaTeX (depending on
whom is teaching them, this is sometimes the case for CS3102 and
CS4102), and nearly all research papers are written this way.  You are
not required to produce beautifully-typeset problem sets for CS2102 and
shouldn&rsquo;t spend inordinate extra time just trying to make your answers
look great, but we will definitely appreciate your efforts to make
submissions easier to read, and after a small effort in getting started
with LaTeX, you may find that it takes less time than hand-writing
(especially since it is easy to edit, instead of needing to rewrite).</p>
