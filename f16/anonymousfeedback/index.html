  <p>I wanted to discuss two anonymous comments that were submitted through
Collab (there&rsquo;s no way to respond directly to submitters, so I&rsquo;ll post
my response here).</p>

<p>Comment 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The homework is significantly longer and harder than Edwards&rsquo;. Also, it extends beyond lecture content too much :(</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comment 2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Professor,</em><br />
<em>I believe that we are moving in too fast a pace at the current moment. I am truly enjoying the class material however before I am fully able to grasp the concepts we quickly move on to the next. I understand that this class moves fast however I have attended every single lecture and still did not understand how to solve quite a few of the questions in problem set 2. In fact in more than one instance I had no idea what some of the questions were asking. I would appreciate it if we could have a brief overview of the problem set before they are due. I appreciate you taking the time to address the questions in the later part of the week but we had about 15 minutes to ask pertinent questions for an assignment due less than 48 hours.</em><br />
<em>I am truly enjoying this class but I will fall very far behind in this class if we continue to go at the pace we are. If we could solve more sample questions related to the problem sets I feel it would go a long way in understanding how to utilize the tools we are being taught.</em><br />
<em>I hope I am not out of line. I also didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable bringing this up personally because I am not sure if I am in the majority, minority, or the rarity. I have never had problems with a math course before and have been comfortable doing proofs prior to this. I suppose I am not as fast a learner as the class demands.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, I do appreciate getting comments like this, and although I would
hope most students feel that they could safely send comments like this
without needing anonymity, I understand why you prefer to send them
anonymously.</p>

<p>As for the content of Comment #1, what you should be worried about is if the workload
for the course seems unreasonably high for a 3-unit class.  As the
university defines things, a 3-unit course is supposed to involve 9
hours of academic work per week (assuming you are coming to class for
2.5 hours per week, this leaves 6.5 hours for outside work).  It is
sometimes hard to estimate how long it will take students to do an
assignment, but I don&rsquo;t think the readings and problem sets assigned so
far in this course should take more than this for most students.</p>

<p>If you find you are spending unreasonably more than this, then it is
either because you are not using the time effectively (this is
especially a challenge when students work in teams to keep everyone
focused and on task); you are trying to do more than is intended (which
is great if you have time for it); you are solving problems using a
tedious, painstaking approach rather than looking for a clever, fast
solution (e.g., making an exhaustive truth table for a 7-input
function); you are lacking in some of the necessary background or
experience so need more time; or (perhaps most likely) because I have
grossly underestimated how long things take when you are learning them
for the first time (and me teaching them for the first time).</p>

<p>I do want to understand if things are taking too long and why, so if it
seems like the workload for the course is unreasonable I encourage you
to come to office hours and discuss what you are doing and whether their
might be more effective ways to use your time.</p>

<p>As for the problems &ldquo;extending beyond lecture content&rdquo;, that is
absolutely what you should expect (indeed, ambitious students should be
insulted by assignments that don&rsquo;t go beyond what was covered in
lecture!).  The problems are not designed to just test if you have been
paying attenting in class and can repeat what is done in class in a
straightforward way.  Sometimes there will be &ldquo;warm-up&rdquo; problems
intended to check basic understanding, but the goal of most of the
problem set problems is to deepen your understanding of the concepts
introduced in class and in the book and improve your abilities as a
mathematical thinker, by having you apply them yourself in ways you
haven&rsquo;t seen before.</p>

<p>For Comment #2, I agree that we have covered a lot quite quickly at the
beginning of the course.  In general, there is always a tension between
wanting to include and get to the most interesting material and making
sure the foundations are strong.</p>

<p>The best way to make sure I spend more class time on topics is to ask
questions about them.  My default assumption (which I know is
na&#239;ve, but I also think is fair) is that if something is explained
well in the assigned readings and no one asks questions about it, then I
shouldn&rsquo;t waste class time going over it (unless I have something I
think is worthwhile beyond or different from what was in the reading).
So far (scanning over <code>#general</code> now), very few students have asked
questions like this; nearly all the questions are about clarifying
specific problems from the problem sets.  I am happy to spend more class
time on topics covered in the book if people ask questions about them.
It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a precise question - its fine to ask things
like, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand the set builder notation, can you go over an
example in class?&rdquo; (otherwise, I think its quite boring to talk about
set builder notation, and that what is written in the book is sufficient
for everyone to understand it without me spending time on it in class).</p>

<p>The other thing I want to say on this is that we&rsquo;ve introduced a lot of
new things fast, but all of the main themes of the course will keep
recurring throughout the semester.  In particular, towards the two main
goals of getting good at making and using definitions, and understanding
and constructing proofs, most of the concepts we have introduced already
will be seen over and over again throughout the course.  The new topics
will build on the knowledge and understanding you have, but also (I
hope) deepen your understanding of the early topics.</p>

<p>(As one concrete example, following the design of the book, we
introduced well-ordering proofs early.  We will soon get to proof by
induction, which is dependent on well-ordering, and similar to
well-ordering proofs in many ways.  Proof by induction is probably the
most powerful proof technique you&rsquo;ll learn in this class, and one used
all the time in computer science, and we&rsquo;ll see many different examples
of proof by induction throughout the semester since its something that
most people need to see many times in different ways and contexts before
really getting it.)</p>

<p>Finally, in terms of the overall pacing, my plan for the course (which
is very much flexible) is to cover about half the material that is
covered in the comparable MIT course.  This seems reasonable to me since
I expect UVA students to be as good as MIT students, but the way MIT
classes work students take fewer courses than UVA students do (it would
be more like a 4-unit class here), and there is a lot more class time
than we have (they have 3 meetings a week, plus recitation, and four
evening &ldquo;midterm&rdquo; exams), so the actual class time is about 2x what we
have.  As another example, <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70/sp15/#syllabus">Berkeley&rsquo;s CS70
class</a> covers
things with a quite different approach, but also covers fair bit more
material than is planned for cs2102 (and with resources more like we
have as a public school, they expect students to do their own homework
grading).  If you think I shouldn&rsquo;t expect you to be competitive with
Berkeley or MIT students, you can also compare to the <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~baruah/Teaching/2015-2Fa/">UNC
course</a>, which covers
a similar amount of material to this course but with 8am Monday
lectures.  (I do, of course, have much higher expectations of UVA
students than what <a href="https://www.math.vt.edu/people/mcquain/math2534.htm">Virginia
Tech</a> does, but I
hope you would not use that as a sign that our expectations are too
high!)</p>
