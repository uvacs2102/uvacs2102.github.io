  <p>Here are my (in progress) responses to more questions submitted in the
registration surveys (see <a href="/surveyquestions">Part 1</a> for the first set
of responses).  Sorry its taking a long time to answer these questions,
but there are lots of great questions submitted, and I will eventually
get to them all.</p>

<p><div class="question">
How to get better
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Practice! (This applies to pretty much everything).  But, its important
to practice in a way that maximimizes benefit and avoids getting stuck
in local maxima.  The best kind of practice involves honest and direct
feedback, and interaction with people at both levels above and levels
below yourself.  We hope the problem sets in this class will provide
plenty of opportunity for effective practice.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
The syllabus said that students who do exceptionally well will be offered positions in your research group. I am interested in encryption research and I was wondering what I would have to do to be considered for a position in your research group.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Excellent!  Thanks for reading to the end of the syllabus.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to consider anyone who expresses interest for a summer
position in my research group, but want to try and have a good
expectation that it will be a positive and worthwhile experience for
both of us before offering a position.  The main things I want to see
are <em>curiosity</em> and <em>initiative</em>.  Beyond that, it does help to show
that you can do well on the content in the class, but it is not
necessary to be the best student or to do consistently well.  Much more
valuable to do one impressive thing (which could be something in the
class like solving a challenge problem, or something you&rsquo;ve done on your
own, like building an interesting mobile app or writing a blog, etc.).
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
I would like to learn everything I would need to know to be able to build big programs.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
This class is more relevant for building <em>small</em> programs that do a lot,
than for building <em>big</em> programs.</p>

<p>The main challenge in building big programs is managing complexity and
the best tool for managing complexity is to define clean and limited
interfaces between components.  This class might help some for that, at
least in terms of the underlying skills, becuase it should improve your
ability to think clearly about precise definitions and to strive for
minimal requirements.</p>

<p>If you want to learn how to build big programs successfully the best
thing to do is to actually try building progressively bigger programs,
and to join and contribute to open source projects where you&rsquo;ll get
mentoring from people with experience building (and maintaining, which
is often the hardest part!) big programs.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
I love interesting classes, but I also get really stressed about
grades. They don&rsquo;t matter as much as I have been told they do, but my
mind is conditioned to value them. I just hope this class will be more
interesting than stressful! The article we just had to read definitely
fell into interesting and I would have enjoyed that on my own.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
When you were in high school, you were probably told that grades were
essential to getting into a good college, and you followed this advice
well and were smart enough to do well, that&rsquo;s how you ended up at UVA.</p>

<p>In college, grades have much less significance.  There is,
unfortunately, one exception to that which is getting into the CS
majors.  I hope this will change, and also encourage students to not
accept being turned away from their desired major without a fight, but
for now the unfortunate reality is that slots in the CS majors have been
capped, and admissions are decided nearly entirely based on arbitrary
GPA cut-offs.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there is very little that depends on your college grades (as
long as they are respectable enough that you don&rsquo;t run into trouble with
academic probation or anything like that).</p>

<p>If you want to go to graduate school (in computing, at least) after
college, it is a little better to have great grades than to have
mediocre grades (although perfect or near-perfect grades will probably
count against you), but far more important to have an impressive
accomplishment and reference letters.  Being a significant author on a
research paper is the most important determiner in getting into the best
PhD programs, and having letters from known researchers who can provide
a lot of detail about interesting and impressive things you have done is
the next most important thing.  Most reviewers of PhD applications won&rsquo;t
even look at grades, or GPAs, except to possible check grades in a few
key courses, and if the reason for getting poor grades in some less
important classes is that you were more focused on doing some exciting
research, so much the better!</p>

<p>If you want a software development job in industry, there are some
(mostly big, old) companies that will have GPA cut-offs in their hiring
searches, but generally the more interesting and worthwhile the company
you are seeking to work for, the less they care about grades and the
more they want to see evidence of what you can accomplish on your own
initiative.  Contributing significantly to an open source project,
building your own interesting web/mobile app, initiating and leading a
student club, providing a technical and leadership contribution to a
service organization, etc., are all much more impressive and meaningful
evidence that you would be a valuable employee for most companies and
any number of As in your classes.</p>

<p>As for what we can do in cs2102, I do try to make things less stressful
for students, but sometimes things intended to reduce stress are
misinterpreted and actually increase student stress.  I believe being
somewhat vague about what is expected and how grading is done is highly
beneficial for learning.  My favorite quote about this is from John
Stigloe (who was a professor at Harvard, but it applies equally to UVA
students):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This generation of students got into Harvard by doing exactly and precisely what teacher wants. If teacher is vague about what he wants, they work a lot harder to figure out what they want and whether or not it is good. The vaguer the directions, the more likely the opportunity for serendipity to happen. It drives them nuts!</em> (Harvard Professor John Stilgoe on &ldquo;60 Minutes&rdquo;, 4 January 2004)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, I understand that uncertainty is one of the main things that
causes stress for students (and I don&rsquo;t really want to drive students
nuts!).  I hope students will view the vagueness in my courses as
meaning there are many and varried opportunities to show that you
deserve an A in the class, and that I can be trusted to treat everyone
fairly.</p>

<p>The other main cause of grading stress, I believe, is students fearing
that even though they understand the material well and are putting in a
solid effort, that they are at risk of getting less-than-desired grade
because of making little mistakes.  Grading done where each question is
&ldquo;out of&rdquo; some number of points, and there are various ways to lose
specific numbers of points for making mistakes, and the grade is
computed as the total of all the points over all the questions,
exaccerbates this stress in two ways.</p>

<p>First, it means students are mostly focused on getting to the threshold
&ldquo;full credit&rdquo; answer and fearful of anything that might cause point
deductions.  This stifles creativity and ambition.</p>

<p>Second, over the course of a set of assignments, it means it is nearly
impossible to recover from one misstep.  If 90% is needed for an &ldquo;A&rdquo;
grade, it takes 3 grades of 95 to make up for one 75, and 5 grades of 95
to make up for one 65.  With the grading system I use, one great
assignment (or one successful challenge solution), is enough to make up
for several poor assignments.  I&rsquo;m looking for evidence that students
have understood important concepts and shown that they can use them
effectively, not for signs of occasional slip-ups.</p>

<p>I hope students find the grading systems I use to be less stressful, and
more conducive to ambition and creativity.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
People tell me if discrete doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me I will not do well in the class. What can I do to make it &ldquo;click&rdquo;?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I don&rsquo;t think anything worthwhile for you to learn &ldquo;clicks&rdquo; right away.
Usually when something &ldquo;clicks&rdquo;, it is because of lots of struggling and
effort beforehand, setting up your mind for the &ldquo;click&rdquo; to happen.</p>

<p>So, the main thing I would say is don&rsquo;t be distressed if you see other
people getting things more quickly than you do.  Its probably not
because they have some magic discrete math gene that enables them to
understand things that you are lacking.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure no such gene
exists.  Instead, when someone learns something quickly it is probably
because they had a lot of previous experience that gave them the context
necessary for the new concept to make sense.</p>

<p>When things seem overly hard to learn, instead of getting frustrated,
your goal should be to figure out what context you are missing that is
making it hard to learn.  Rather than getting stuck on the new concept,
go back to the previous ones that it is building on and make sure you
really understand them (a great way to do this is to try and explain
them to someone else who might be confused on them).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t just assume you understand things because you can read solutions
to problems and they seem to make sense, make sure you do by working out
the problems yourself and then comparing them to others&rsquo; solutions.  The
collaboration policy for the assignments in this class is intended to
encourage this, and I hope students will take advantage of it, and use
opportunities to work with others as ways to improve each other&rsquo;s
understanding.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
Will this course be focused solely on mathematical proofs, or a broad range of proofs (i.e. Evaluating conspiracy claims)?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
We will concentrate on proofs about mathematical propositions, with a
focus on ones that are (at least loosely) relevant to computing.  The
nice thing about mathematical propositions and proofs is that they can
be stated precisely and umambiguously, and the methods of reasoning are
well established and universal.  Many of the reasoning methods we&rsquo;ll see
for mathematical proofs are also relevant to discussions about things in
the physical world, but the &ldquo;rules of evidence&rdquo; and methods of reasoning
are much less clear and much in dispute (e.g., outright lying seems to
have become pretty much acceptable in our current political discourse,
but assuming any falsehood would completely invalidate any mathematical
proof).  I would encourage everyone to take a philosophy class to look
more deeply at how formal reasoning can be used to understand things in
the real world, but for this class we will mostly stay in the safe world
of mathematical abstractions.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
As a double major in Math and CS, I am also taking the Transition to Higher Mathematics course this semester. Do you believe these proof-based courses would work in conjunction?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I would expect so!  I&rsquo;m sure there will be lots of connections between
the two classes, and would encourage you to share any extra insights you
get with me and the class.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
whats your middle name
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I provide that only on a &ldquo;need-to-know&rdquo; basis.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
How much of a computer/computing/etc. background do I need to succeed in this class?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
You are expected to have at least some programming experience (enough to
understand and write simple programs), and I also assume everyone in the
modern world has had a lot of experience using complex computing
systems.  I think some parts of the class will probably have more
relevance to people with more programming experience, and I&rsquo;ll try to
relate some of the abstract concepts in the class to things that some
students may have encountered in programming (but others will not have
yet seen), but it is not necessary to have substantial computing
background to do well in this class.</p>

<p>The only official prerequisite is cs11xx or equivalent, so if it seems
like anything is ever unfairly assuming more CS background than you
should expect to have by satisfying that prerequisite, you should make
sure to let me know. </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
Is there any actual coding involved in the course?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Its possible there will be some problems that involve programming, but
it will not be a major part of the course.  There will be challenge and
optional problems that might be infeasible to solve without programming.</p>

<p>It will definitely be possible to earn an A in the class without doing
any programming.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
I always enjoy hearing about the instructor&rsquo;s life/achievements. I feel like it makes them seem more human ,and also makes me feel excited to learn under such a distinguished person in their field.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Wow, that&rsquo;s flattering!  (I&rsquo;m not sure if it is more flattering to seem
human, or to be a &ldquo;distinguished person&rdquo;, but either way, I appreciate
the question.)</p>

<p>As for my life, it is mostly focused around my children (a four-year old
daughter, and 17-month old son).  Since having children, I view any
professional accomplishment as inconsequential compared to my hopes of
being a good parent and raising decent and fulfilled children.</p>

<p>As for my achievements and experiences in computing and teaching, the
ones I think are most significant are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When I was an undergraduate at MIT, I was an undergraduate researcher
in Marc Raibert&rsquo;s robotics lab where I worked on making
physically-realistic animations of kangaroo-like creatures.  One day
Prof. Raibert came into the lab and told us we should make the
creatures look like dinosaurs instead, but he couldn&rsquo;t explain why.  A
few weeks later he came back from a meeting with people in Hollywood,
saying he thought he had convinced them it would be possible to make a
sufficiently realistic animated dinosaur for a movie (which turned out
to be Jurassic Park).  As an undergraduate, I also had an opportunity
to work as an intern in John Backus&rsquo; group at IBM Almaden, on a
functional programming language.  John was a UVA dropout, who had gone
on to lead the Fortan project at IBM, develop what is now known as
Backus-Naur Form, and then lead a programming language research group
at IBM Almaden.</p></li>

<li><p>The main research I did as a graduate student at MIT (which didn&rsquo;t end
up actually as part of my PhD dissertation) was to develop a tool for
lightweight static checking, that would take advantage of annotations
added to C programs to be able to warn programmers about likely
programming errors.  The tool I mostly built ended up being quite
widely used, and included in many Linux distributions.  (The work was
mostly done in 1993-1996, with some more doing after I came to UVA in
1999-2001, but I still get bug reports form people using <a href="http://www.splint.org/">the
tool</a>.  Some of the ideas we had for checking
memory use in C programs are now being used, in farily similar form,
in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust programming language</a>,
although I have no direct involvement in this.)</p></li>

<li><p>One of my first goals after starting at UVA (where I joined as a
professor in 1999) was to develop a new introductory computing course
targeted for College of Arts and Sciences students and intended for
people who were only expected to take one computing course.  This
started as a <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pubs/teachingfellowship.pdf">University Teaching Fellowship
Proposal</a>,
and the first course was offered as <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs200-spring2002/">cs200: <em>Computer Science from Ada
and Euclid to Quantum Computing and the World Wide
Web</em></a> in 2002.
Initially, there were about 20 students in the class, but more than
half of them dropped out after the first problem set which was not
well designed.  But, the remaining 9 students stuck with the class and
over the years it developed.  Since some students who took it wanted
to continue into other computing courses but were not allowed to in
the curriculum we had then, I created a follow-on course (initially
offered as <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs201j-fall2002/">cs201j: Engineering
Software</a>, and
with <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/snakes/">Snakes!</a>),
which could lead into our other CS courses (it counted as what is now
cs2110, and satisfied the prerequisite for cs2150).</p></li>

<li><p>Based on the success of these courses and the quality of students we
were finding in the College, I pushed for creating a CS major that was
open to CLAS students.  In fall 2005, I was given support from my
Department Chair to lead an effort to create a CS degree for the
College, and after putting together a committee to help with this and
designing a curriculum, the Interdisciplinary Major in Comptuer
Science (BACS) degree was approved in 2006, and we graduated our first
three students in 2007.  By the time I stepped down as BACS director,
the BACS had grown to be larger than any other major offered by the
Engineering school.</p></li>

<li><p>I wrote an open textbook based around the cs200/cs150/cs1120 course,
<a href="http://computingbook.org"><em>Introduction to Computing: Explorations in Language, Logic, and
Machines</em></a>.  Although it was not widely
adopted, it does have some eager readers and I get occasional emails
from people who have used it as a self-study book.  It also was the
main thing that led to me being recruited by an open education startup
to teach their first course.  (You can read about my experiences as
the first VP of Education for Udacity here: <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2013/02/cs101-one-year-later.html">CS101: One Year
Later</a>, and
my favorite article about this is <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/online-universities-udacity-grand-challenge-david-stavens-dave-evans"><em>Professors without borders: Will
online learning spell the end of
universities?</em></a>, not just because it somehow claims I have &ldquo;Monty Python humour&rdquo;.)</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve had a chance to teach many <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/students/">remarkable
students</a> who have gone on
to do amazing and wonderful things.  Although its always hard to know
how much impact one actually has, one of the joys and privledges of
being a professor is to follow the careers of your students and to
feel like you can claim some credit for them.  Some of the students
who have worked in my research group include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29K7ldNlH6s&amp;feature=youtu.be">Adrienne Porter
Felt</a>
(<a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/computer-science-grad-stands-watch-users-googles-popular-browser">UVAToday</a>

when she was an undergraduate in my research group, and now leads the
Chrome security team at Google), <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/yh33/">Yan

computation for his PhD in my group, and is now a professor at Indiana
University), <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-hacking-your-phone/">Karsten

worked on RFID security for his PhD in my group, and went on to found

<a href="http://www2.eecs.utk.edu/people/faculty/pauln">Nate Paul</a> (who work
on malware security for his PhD in my group, and has gone on to do
work on medical devices and embedded security at Oak Ridge and
University of Tennessee),
and <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/students/">many others</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve led or been involved in research projects that have come up with
some cool ideas, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DsR4PucAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">a few of which have led to lots of other research as
well as use in
industry</a>.
The most significant are our work on making <a href="http://www.mightbeevil.org/">secure multi-party
computation practical</a>, improving
software security (e.g.,
<a href="http://scriptinspector.org/">ScriptInspector</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/perracotta/">Perracotta</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pubs/infosec05.html">PHPrevent</a>,
and <a href="http://www.splint.org">Split</a>), and <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/mcl/">mobile
networking</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been involved in a few start-up companies, one as a co-founder
(when I was a grad student), one as an early employee (with Udacity,
growing from 5 to ~50 people), and many as an advisor.  I&rsquo;ve learned
from these experiences (mostly that academia is much more pleasant
than industry!), but also have lots of opportunites to work with great
people and see different aspects of companies at various stages.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve written a <a href="http://www.dori-mic.org/">baby book on theoretical computer
science</a>, make some <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/videos/#fun">fun
videos</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/2009-02-19-ofa/">received
an award from Tim
Kaine</a> (back when
he was a lowly governor).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope that helps!  Thanks for asking.
