<p>Before Thursday, everyone should have finished reading MCS Chapter 8.</p>

<p><a href="/ps/ps8"><strong>Problem Set 8</strong></a> is due <strong>Friday (4 November) at 6:29pm</strong>.</p>

<p>I am out of town Wednesday and will not be able to hold my normal office
hours.</p>

<p>Friday, 4 November at 11am (Rotunda Dome Room): <strong>Steve Huffman</strong> (BSCS
2005, co-founder and CEO of Reddit), <em>Computer Science Distinguished
Alumni Speaker</em>.</p>

<h2 id="exam-2">Exam 2</h2>

<p><strong>Exam 2</strong> will be in class on <strong>Thursday, 10 November</strong>.  It will be
  similar in format to Exam 1.  If you need to make special arrangements
  for taking Exam 2, please contact me by the end of this week (Nov 6).</p>

<p><strong>Resources.</strong> As with Exam 1, you will be permitted to use a single
paper page of notes that you prepare and bring to the exam.  It is fine
to collaborate with others to prepare your notes.  The page should be no
larger than a US Letter size page ($8.5 \times 11$ inches), and you may
write (or print) on both sides of the page.  No other resources are
permitted during the exam.</p>

<p><strong>Content.</strong> The problems on the exam will cover material from Classes
  1&ndash;17, Problem Sets 1&ndash;8 (including the provided solutions), and MCS
  Chapters 1&ndash;7.  Exam 2 will emphasize material covered since Exam 1
  (Classes 12&ndash;17, Problem Sets 6&ndash;8, and MCS Chapters 6&ndash;7), but will
  also include questions that cover earlier material in the class.  In
  particular, you should not be at all surprised if Exam 2 includes
  questions very similar to Problem 4 and Problem 8 from Exam 1, so it
  would be quite foolish for any student to go into the exam without
  making sure they understand those problems and their solutions.  There
  will not be any questions about trick-xor-treat protocols, despite
  their practical importance and mathematical beauty.  If you understand
  the problems on the problem sets and questions on the class notes well
  enough to be able to answer similar questions, you should do well on
  the exam.</p>

<p>The main topics the exam will cover include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>State Machines (how to interpret and reason about a state machine
given its formal description, how to model a problem with a state
machine)</p></li>

<li><p>Invariant Principle (you should be able to construct a proof that uses
the invariant principle to reason about properties of reachable
states, and be able to understand proofs that use and mis-use the
invariant principle)</p></li>

<li><p>Termination Proofs (you should be able to prove a state machine
eventually reaches a terminating state, or that a program eventually
terminates)</p></li>

<li><p>Stable Matching (you should understand the definition of a stable
matching and the Gale-Shalpey algorithm for finding a stable matching,
and be able to prove properties about matchings)</p></li>

<li><p>Recursive Data Types (how to define a data type constructively,
operations on recursive data types; lists, trees, and other
recursively defined data types)</p></li>

<li><p>Structural Induction (how to use the principle of structural induction
to reason about all objects of a recursive data type; understand the
connections and differences between structural induction, invariant
principle, and induction on the natural numbers)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For most students, I believe the best way to prepare for the exam will
be to (1) go over exam 1 and the problem sets and their solutions, and
make sure you understand well any of the problems you did not get
before; (2) go through the questions in the class notes and convince
yourself you can answer them well; (3) re-read chapters of the book,
solving the associated practice problems, especially for any sections on
topics where you had difficulty on the problem sets.  If you do #1 and
understand well the problems on the problem set, you should be confident
you&rsquo;ll do well on the exam; if you struggled on the problem sets, you
would benefit from doing #2 and #3 as well.  If you have anything you
want me to review before the exam, post on slack before Monday (7
November).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Courtenay&rsquo;s tenure at Virginia was, in contrast to that of his predecessor, a resounding success. He was described as a model professor: &ldquo;He never by look, act, word, or emphasis disparaged the efforts or undervalued the acquirements of his pupils. His pleasant smile and kind voice, when he would say, &lsquo;Is that answer perfectly correct?&rsquo; gave hope to many minds struggling with science&rdquo;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As mathematics professor, &ldquo;Old Bonny,&rdquo; as he was fondly called, replaced the antiquated British approach to mathematical pedagogy typified by his own father&rsquo;s texts with a new approach borrowed from French mathematicians. British writers had imitated Euclid by clinging to the deductive manner of presenting material. They opened their texts with axioms and definitions and proceeded to the derivation of facts and theorems. Although logically satisfying to mathematicians, the method did little to motivate beginning students. French textbook writers, on the other hand, approached mathematics analytically, leading from concrete examples to abstractions. Bonnycastle introduced this method at the University of Virginia and published his own college textbook, <em>Inductive Geometry, or, An Analysis of the Relations of Form and Magnitude: Commencing with the Elementary Ideas Derived Through the Senses, and Proceeding by a Train of Inductive Reasoning to Develop the Present State of the Science</em> (1834). Painfully prolix even by nineteenth-century standards, the innovative book was not a financial success.  (Excerpt from article by Karen Parshall)</p>

<h1 id="infinite-sets">Infinite Sets</h1>

<p><strong>Finite Cardinality.</strong> The <em>cardinality</em> of the set
$$
\mathbb{N}_k = { n | n \in \mathbb{N} \wedge n &lt; k }
$$
is $k$.  If there is a <em>bijection</em> between two sets, they have the same
cardinality.  (Class 9)</p>

<p>Does this definition tell us the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$?</p>

<p>###</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A set $C$ is <em>infinite</em> if there is no bijection between
  $C$ and any set $\mathbb{N}_k$ (as defined above).</p>

<p><strong>Dedekind-Infinite.</strong> A set $A$ is <em>Dedekind-infinite</em> if and only if there exists a strict subset of $A$ with the same cardinality as $A$.  That is,
$$\exists B \subset A \ldotp \exists R \ldotp R\ \text{is a bijection between}\ A\ \text{and}\ B.$$</p>

<p>Are the definitions of (standard) <em>infinite</em> and <em>Dedekind-infinite</em>
equivalent?</p>

<p>##</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A set $C$ is <em>countable</em> if and only if there exists a
  surjective function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $C$.  (That is, $\le 1$ arrow
  out from $\mathbb{N}$, $ge 1$ arrow in to $C$.)</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A set $C$ is <em>countably infinite</em> if and only if there
  exists a bijection between $C$ and $\mathbb{N}$.</p>

<p>Must a <em>countable</em> set that is <em>Dedekind-infinite</em> be <em>countably infinite</em>?</p>

<p>Prove that these sets are countable: $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{N} \times
\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Q}$ (rationals), $\emptyset$, $\mathbb{N} \cup (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}) \cup (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N})$, all finite sequences of elements of $\mathbb{N}$.</p>
