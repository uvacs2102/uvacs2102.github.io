This problem set is not like the others.   It is <em>optional</em>, and can only count positively.<br />
   If you want an opportunity to present, the deadline is <strong>Sunday, 4 December</strong> at <strong>6:29pm</strong>.  The final submission deadline is <strong>Tuesday, 6 December</strong> at <strong>11:59pm</strong> (although this can be extended on request).</p>

<p>You should do it if you have an
   idea for something worthwhile, fun, or interesting to do (that&rsquo;s a
   logical or, not an exclusive xor).  A good submission for this
   assignment can also help your grade, counting like a bonus problem
   set.  An excellent submission could count like two bonus problem
   sets.</div></p>

<h3 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h3>

<p>For this assignment, you may work alone or with as many other people
as you choose. If you work in a team, your team should jointly post a
single submission with all of your names on it. All team members will
receive the same credit, unless you specify and justify an uneven
distribution in your submission. Your team may be as large as you
want, but the expectations for quality and value of your submission
scale according to <span class="math">sqrt(<em>N</em>)</span> (that
is, a team with 4 people should do something twice as impressive as an
individual to merit the same credit; if you are able to convince all
202 students in the class to join your team, you should do something
approximately 14.2 times as impressive as what would be expected from
a single student). You are welcome to include people not in the class
in your team (and they do not increase the value of <span
class="math"><em>N</em></span>).</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>Create an artifact that conveys some idea from this class to a
selected target audience.</p>

<h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3>

<p>You can define your target audience but should specify what it
is. Examples of target audiences include &ldquo;typical third graders&rdquo;,
&ldquo;your parents&rdquo;, &ldquo;UVa students majoring in history&rdquo;, &ldquo;Martians&rdquo;, &ldquo;cs1110
students&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Your artifact can be anything you want, so long as it includes some
representation as a finite sequence of bits that can be posted on the
Internet. Examples of possible artifacts include a written story, a
comic, a video, a song (lyrics), or an interpretive dance.  If your
artifact cannot be posted on the Internet (for example, if you bake a
cake, build a quantum computer, or develop a time machine) you should
still make some description of your artifact (including a picture if
helpful) that can be posted.</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>You should submit your artifact by use this web form:
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMqhD_T3hUvNB0uLWr1Cs8VmIWsJPtHYLajTJV4Y1RLioq1w/viewform">Problem Set Omega Submission Form</a>.</p>

<p>Your submission should include: (a) a description of your target audience; and (b) a
  link to your artifact, hosted at a URL that will not disappear
  shortly after you graduate.  Your submission may also (optionally) include a
  <em>poetic license</em> statement.  Everything technical in your artifact
  should be correct, unless you carefully document how you know it is
  incorrect. To convey the essence of an idea effectively to a general
  audience, it may be necessary to simplify some things in ways that
  are not technically correct but do not violate the important essence
  of the idea. If you do this, include a poetic license statement to your
  submission that explains and justifies your decisions (otherwise,
  you will lose points for any technical inaccuracies).</p>

<h2 id="optional-presentation">Optional Presentation</h2>

<p>If you would like to present, perform, or share your artifact in class
on 6 December (the last day of class), you must submit your request by
<strong>6:29pm</strong> on <strong>Sunday, 4 December</strong>.  Your request should explain
what you would like to do and how much time you think you need for
this. Given the size of the class, it may not be possible for all
teams that want to present to do so, so selection will be done based
on what you submit with an emphasis on things that will be worthwhile
or enjoyable for the whole class.  What you submit on 4 December does
not need to be your final submission, but it should be enough to make
a decision on whether or not it should be presented.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation Criteria</h2>

<p>Submissions will be evaluated on technical correctness and perceived
effectiveness in conveying an important idea to your defined target
audience.  Aesthetic merit, entertainment value, and creativity are
also important, but only in as much as they support the goal of
conveying an idea from discrete math to your target audience.</p>

<h2 id="motivating-examples">Motivating Examples</h2>

<p>To give you some ideas, here are some examples of things students have
done in past years for similar assignments (but with different topics,
because of being in either Theory of Computation course or
Introduction to Computing).</p>

(cs3102: Theory of Computation, Spring 2010) (you can see all the
submissions <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs3102/?p=304">here</a>,
but many of the links don&rsquo;t work anymore since people used their
<em>people.virginia.edu</em> pages)</p>

<p>The most successful (at least by number of views) is Authur Gordon, Allison Gurlitz, Stephen Lam, and Eugene Moy&rsquo;s <em>A &ldquo;Downfall&rdquo; Parody: P = NP</em>:
