<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

<p>Solve as many of the nine problems as you can.  For maximum credit, your
answers should be correct, clear, well-written, and convincing.  The
problem marked with $(\star\star)$ is challenging enough that it is not
necessary to solve them well to get a ``gold-star level&rdquo; grade on this
assignment (although we certainly hope you will try and some will
succeed!)</p>

<li><p>Assume $R: A \rightarrow B$ is an <em>total</em> <em>injective</em> relation
between $A$ and $B$.  What must be true about the relationship between
$|A|$ and $|B|$?</p></li>

<li><p>Assume $R: A \rightarrow B$ is an <em>total</em> <em>surjective</em> <em>function</em>
between $A$ and $B$.  What must be true about the relationship between
$|A|$ and $|B|$?</p></li>

<li><p>Prove that for any two sets $A$ and $B$, $| A \times B | = |A| \cdot
|B|$.  (Recall the definition of set products from <a href="/class8">Class 8</a>.)</p></li>

<h1 id="induction">Induction</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>In <a href="/ps/ps2">Problem Set 2</a> (Problem 6) you used the well-ordering
principle to prove that any integer value less that $2^{k+1}$ can be
written as $a_1 \cdot 2^1 + a_2 \cdot 2^2 + \cdots + a_k 2^k$ where all
the $a_i$ values are either 0 or 1.  Prove the same property using
induction.</p></li>

<li><p>Prove by induction that every non-empty finite set of rational
numbers has a minimum element.  (Bonus: explain why this does not
contradict the fact that the rational numbers are not well ordered.)</p></li>

<li><p>A <em>convex polygon</em> is a polygon where all line segments connecting
any two points in the polygon are fully contained in the polygon.  For
example, of the three polygons below, the left two are convex, but the
rightmost one is not.  Prove by induction that any convex polygon with
$n$ sides can be divided into $n - 2$ triangles.</p></li>

<h1 id="donation-by-induction">Donation by Induction</h1>

<p>(The following questions are loosely inspired by the Stata Center
problem in Section 5.1.5, but any similarity to any real university is
purely coincidental.)</p>

<p>Following the successful completion of the restoration of the Rotunda,
the Board of Transients of the highly prestigious University of East
Virginia, is embarking on a bold, new fund-raising initiative known as
the Cornerbrick Plan.  The highest priority is to tear down the
monstrous <a href="http://www.streakingthelawn.com/2016/4/1/11330962/virginia-football-bronco-mendenhall-demolishes-scott-stadium-team-must-earn-it-april-fools">Scotty
Stadium</a>
to improve the view from the upper offices in Rice&rsquo;s Theorem Hall.
Unfortunately, it is proving harder to attract donors to fund a
destruction project than it is to fund building something new that you
can name.</p>

<p>So, a nimble board member suggests the following general process:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The stadium is demolished, and the bricks are grouped into $n$ piles.</p></li>

<li><p>For each donation, the donor gets to take one or more bricks from
any one pile of their choice.</p></li>

<li><p>The donor who removes the last brick gets to rename the University.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Assume there are two donors, Alice Moneybags and Bob Billionaire, who
take turns making donations and taking bricks, and it is Alice&rsquo;s turn
first.</p>

<p>So, for example, if there is only one pile left (with any number of
bricks), Alice can remove that pile and win (get to rename the
University).</p>

<p>If there are two piles with one brick each, Alice has to take at least
one brick.  Whichever one she chooses, there is one pile left for Bob,
and Bob wins.</p>

<p>If there are two piles left with two bricks each, Alice can either (1)
remove one brick, leaving one pile with one brick, and one pile with two
bricks; then Bob can remove one brick from the two-brick file, leaving
things in the two piles with one brick each situation where Bob wins.
Or, she could (2) remove two bricks to eliminate one pile, but this
leaves the one-pile situation where it is Bob&rsquo;s turn so Bob wins.  Thus,
whatever Alice does starting from the two piles of two bricks each
situation, Bob wins.</p>

<p>Player 1 can win the game if there is a move she can make, such that no
matter what move the other player makes, it results in a situation where
Player 1 can still win the game.  That is, player 1 has a winning
strategy, if there is a way for player 1 to choose her moves so that no
matter what player 2 does, player 1 can win.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Prove that if the bricks are divided into $n$ piles of a single brick
each, the player who moves first wins if $n$ is odd.  You should use
induction for your proof (even if there may be easier ways to prove this
without using induction), since setting this up as an induction proof
will help you with the following questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Suppose the bricks are divided into two piles, of size $x$ and $y$.
We can describe the configuration of our stadium bricks as a sequence of
the number of bricks in each piles.  So, the starting configuration is
$(x, y)$.  State clearly who should win the game dependent on $x$ and
$y$, and provide a proof to support your answer.  (Hint: you may find it
helpful to first consider the situation where $x = y$, and prove a lemma
about that.)</p></li>

<li><p>($\star\star$) Suppose the bricks are divided into <em>three</em> piles, of
size $x$, $y$, and $z$.  State clearly who should win the game as a
function of $x$, $y$, and $z$, and provide a convincing proof to support
your answer.  (This is rated as a $\star\star$ problem, assuming you
come up with an answer on your own or with your team, without using any
material from outside of this course to solve it.)</p></li>
