<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>

<p>Today, we want to bre able to answer the following questions. The first two are already discussed in class, but we will study them more generally.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How many subsets does $S$ have if $|S|=n$?
\item How many numbers are there that can be represented with (at most) $n$ bits (in base 2) ?
\item How many (at most) 16-bit numbers with exactly 4 ones?
\item How many ways to choose 12 doughnuts from 5 varieties?
\end{enumerate}</p>

<p>The first two have the same answers $2^n$. In fact, because there is a bijection between the set of answers to problem 1 and problem 2, then we already knew that they have the same answers. More generally, all counting problems of today&rsquo;s class could be described as &ldquo;what is the size of a set $A$?&rdquo; We use the definitino of finite cardinality from Class 9, to study these questions. Namely, we try to find another set $B$ whose cardinality is knwon, and that there is a bijection between $A$ and $B$.</p>

<h1 id="why-counting">Why Counting?</h1>

<p>Being able to count (exactly or even approximately) is important for many reasons, some of which are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Estimating the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of an algorithm, this could be time, space, etc. This comes up when we try to analyze the &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; of an algorithm.
\item Estimating the &ldquo;security&rdquo; of a cryptographic algorithm. Basically, we would like to know how big is the &ldquo;space of keys&rdquo; from which the adversary has to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; the correct one.
\item Counting is the fundamental to probability theory.
\end{itemize}</p>

<h1 id="counting-rules">Counting Rules</h1>

<p><strong>Product Rule</strong> If $A_1,\dots,A_n$ are finite sets, then the size of their cartesian product is
$$|A_1 \times \dots \times A_n| = |A_1| \cdot |A_2| \dots |A_n| $$</p>

<p>We previously saw this rule in Class 7, but we will use it more heavily today, and we will see some extensions of it.</p>

<p>Using the product rule, formally prove that the answer to the first two example problems are both $2^n$. (Hint, let $S={a_1,\dots,a_n}$ and let $A_i = {a_i}$.)</p>

<p>#
#
#</p>

<p><strong>Sum Rule</strong>. If $A_1,\dots,A_n$ are finite \emph{disjoint} sets, then the size of their \emph{union} is
$$|A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_n| = |A_1| + |A_2| \dots +|A_n|.$$</p>

<p>The sum rule is even simpler than the product rule, but together with the product rule, theye become very powerful.</p>

<p>Using the product and sum rules, count now many passwords of 6 to 8 characters exist if the first character can be an english letter (upper or lower case) and the rest could also be a digit.</p>

<p><strong>Generalized product rule</strong> Suppose $S$ is a set containing length-$k$ sequences like $(a_1,\dots,a_k)$. If there are $n_i$ possibilities for $i$&lsquo;th entry $a_i$ for any possible prefix $a<em>1,\dots,a</em>{i-1}$, then  $|S|=n_1 \cdot n_2 \dots n_k$.</p>

<p>Using the generalizd product rule, prove that the number of permutations over any set $S={s_1,\dots,s_n}$ is $n!$. A permutation is simply a sequence $(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ where each $s_i$ appears in that sequence exactly once.</p>

<p>#
#
#</p>

<p><strong>Division Rule</strong>. If $f \colon A \to B$ is a $k$ to $1$ (total surjective) function, and if $A,B$ are finite sets then, $|A| = k \cdot |B|$.</p>

<h1 id="counting-when-order-does-not-matter">Counting  when order does not matter</h1>

<p>The number of subsets of size $k$ of  ${1,\dots,n}$ captures a counting problem in which the order of the $k$
 selected elements does not matter. This number is so important that has its own notation ${n \choose k}$.</p>

<p>Using the division rule, prove that ${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}$</p>

<p><strong>when repetition is allowed</strong>. Note that in the problem above, we cannot select the same element $s_i$ from $S$ more than once, but suppose we consider the selections to be &ldquo;multi-sets&rdquo; where the order of elements do not matter, but they could be selected more than once. This is a way to model the third example problem about donuts.</p>

<p>Give a bijection between the sets that model the following two counting problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Selecting $k$ elements from  ${1,\dots,n}$ as a &ldquo;multi-set&rdquo;; namely, the order of selection does not matter, but we \emph{can} select an element more than once.
\item Number of sequences of $0,1$ with $k-1$ ones, and $n$ zeros.
\end{itemize}</p>

<p>Using the above bijection, show that the answer to the example counting problems 3 and 4 are both equal to 4845.</p>

<p>#
#</p>

<h1 id="proof-by-counting">Proof by counting</h1>

<p>Prove Pascal&rsquo;s triangle identity:
$${n \choose k} = {n \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k-1}.$$</p>

<h2 id="excerpt">Excerpt</h2>

<p>G. H. Hardy, <a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss/misc/A%20Mathematician's%20Apology.pdf"><em>A Mathematician&rsquo;s Apology</em></a>, 1940.</p>

<p><blockquote>
A man <font color="gray">(sic - Hardy&rsquo;s quote, unfortunately, but typical for 1940, uses <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html">sexist language</a> throughout, but I will leave it as written, but &ldquo;man&rdquo; here means &ldquo;person&rdquo;, and &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; are not meant to be limited to males)</font> who sets out to justify his existence and his activities
has to distinguish two different questions. The first is whether the
work which he does is worth doing; and the second is why he does it,
whatever its value may be. The first question is often very difficult,
and the answer very discouraging, but most people will find the second
easy enough even then. Their answers, if they are honest, will usually
take one or other of two forms; and the second form is a merely a
humbler variation of the first, which is the only answer we need
consider seriously.</p>

<p>(1) ‘I do what I do because it is the one and only thing that I
can do at all well. I am a lawyer, or a stockbroker, or a professional
cricketer, because I have some real talent for that particular
job. I am a lawyer because I have a fluent tongue, and am
interested in legal subtleties; I am a stockbroker because my
judgment of the markets is quick and sound; I am a professional
cricketer because I can bat unusually well. I agree that it might be
better to be a poet or a mathematician, but unfortunately I have no
talent for such pursuits.’</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that this is a defence which can be made
by most people, since most people can do nothing at all well. But
it is impregnable when it can be made without absurdity, as it can
by a substantial minority: perhaps five or even ten percent of men
can do something rather well. It is a tiny minority who can do
something really well, and the number of men who can do two
things well is negligible. If a man has any genuine talent he
should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate
it to the full.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>There is also what I call the ‘humbler variation’ of the standard
apology; but I may dismiss this in a very few words.</p>

<p>(2) ‘There is nothing that I can do particularly well. I do what I
do because it came my way. I really never had a chance of doing
anything else.’ And this apology too I accept as conclusive. It is
quite true that most people can do nothing well. If so, it matters
very little what career they choose, and there is really nothing
more to say about it. It is a conclusive reply, but hardly one likely
to be made by a man with any pride; and I may assume that none
of us would be content with it.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>A man’s first duty, a young man’s at any rate, is to be
ambitious. Ambition is a noble passion which may legitimately take
many forms; there was something noble in the ambitions of Attila or
Napoleon; but the noblest ambition is that of leaving behind something
of permanent value &mdash;
&hellip;</p>

<p>There are many highly respected motives which may lead men
to prosecute research, but three which are much more important
than the rest. The first (without which the rest must come to
nothing) is intellectual curiosity, desire to know the truth. Then,
professional pride, anxiety to be satisfied with one’s performance,
the shame that overcomes any self-respecting craftsman when his
work is unworthy of his talent. Finally, ambition, desire for
reputation, and the position, even the power or the money, which
it brings. It may be fine to feel, when you have done your work,
that you have added to the happiness or alleviated the sufferings
of others, but that will not be why you did it. So if a mathematician,
or a chemist, or even a physiologist, were to tell me that the
driving force in his work had been the desired to benefit
humanity, then I should not believe him (nor should I think the
better of him if I did). His dominant motives have been those
which I have stated, and in which, surely, there is nothing of
which any decent man need be ashamed.</p>

<p>If intellectual curiosity, professional pride, and ambition are the
dominant incentives to research, then assuredly no one has a
fairer chance of satisfying them than a mathematician. His subject
is the most curious of all—there is none in which truth plays such
odd pranks. It has the most elaborate and the most fascinating
technique, and gives unrivalled openings for the display of sheer
professional skill. Finally, as history proves abundantly,
mathematical achievement, whatever its intrinsic worth, is the
most enduring of all.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.  If
his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are
made with <em>ideas</em>. &hellip; The mathematician’s patterns, like the
painter&rsquo;s or the poet&rsquo;s must be beautiful; the ideas like the colours
or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the
first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly
mathematics.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The fact is that there are few more ‘popular’ subjects than
mathematics. Most people have some appreciation of mathematics,
just as most people can enjoy a pleasant tune; and there are
probably more people really interested in mathematics than in
music. Appearances suggest the contrary, but there are easy
explanations. Music can be used to stimulate mass emotion, while
mathematics cannot; and musical incapacity is recognized (no
doubt rightly) as mildly discreditable, whereas most people are so
frightened of the name of mathematics that they are ready, quite
unaffectedly, to exaggerate their own mathematical stupidity.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>It is undeniable that a good deal of
elementary mathematics—and I use the word ‘elementary’ in the
sense in which professional mathematicians use it, in which it
includes, for example, a fair working knowledge of the differential
and integral calculus—has considerable practical utility.
These parts of mathematics are, on the whole, rather dull; they are
just the parts which have the least aesthetic value. The ‘real’
mathematics of the ‘real’ mathematicians, the mathematics of
Fermat and Euler and Gauss and Abel and Riemann, is almost
wholly ‘useless’ (and this is as true of ‘applied’ as of ‘pure’
mathematics). It is not possible to justify the life of any genuine
professional mathematician on the ground of the ‘utility’ of his
work.</p>

<p>But here I must deal with a misconception. It is sometimes suggested
that pure mathematicians glory in the uselessness of their work, and
make it a boast that it has no practical applications.  The imputation
is usually based on an incautious saying attributed to Gauss, to the
effect that, if mathematics is the queen of the sciences, then the
theory of numbers is, because of its supreme uselessness, the queen of
mathematics—I have never been able to find an exact quotation. I am
sure that Gauss’s saying (if indeed it be his) has been rather crudely
misinterpreted.  If the theory of numbers could be employed for any
practical and obviously honourable purpose, if it could be turned
directly to the furtherance of human happiness or the relief of human
suffering, as physiology and even chemistry can, then surely neither
Gauss nor any other mathematician would have been so foolish as to
decry or regret such applications. <b>But science works for evil as well
as for good (and particularly, of course, in time of war); and both
Gauss and less mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there
is one science at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness
from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle and clean.</b></p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>We have concluded that the trivial mathematics is, on the whole,
useful, and that the real mathematics, on the whole, is not; that the
trivial mathematics does, and the real mathematics does not, ‘do good’
in a certain sense; but we have still to ask whether either sort of
mathematics does harm. It would be paradoxical to suggest that
mathematics of any sort does much harm in time of peace, so that we
are driven to the consideration of the effects of mathematics
on war. It is every difficult to argue such questions at all
dispassionately now, and I should have preferred to avoid them;
but some sort of discussion seems inevitable. Fortunately, it need
not be a long one.</p>

<p><b>There is one comforting conclusions which is easy for a real
mathematician. Real mathematics has no effects on war. No one has yet
discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers
or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for
many years.</b> It is true that there are branches of applied
mathematics, such as ballistics and aerodynamics, which have been
developed deliberately for war and demand a quite elaborate technique:
it is perhaps hard to call them ‘trivial’, but none of them has any
claim to rank as ‘real’. They are indeed repulsively ugly and
intolerably dull; even Littlewood could not make ballistics
respectable, and if he could not who can? So a real mathematician has
his conscience clear; there is nothing to be set against any value his
work may have; mathematics is, as I said at Oxford, a ‘harmless and
innocent’ occupation.</p>

<p>The trivial mathematics, on the other hand, has many applications
in war. The gunnery experts and aeroplane designers, for
example, could not do their work without it. And the general
effect of these applications is plain: mathematics facilitates (if not
so obviously as physics or chemistry) modern, scientific, ‘total’
war.</p>

<p>It is not so clear as it might seem that this is to be regretted,
since there are two sharply contrasted views about modern scientific
war. The first and the most obvious is that the effect of science on
war is merely to magnify its horror, both by increasing the sufferings
of the minority who have to fight and by extending them to other
classes. This is the most natural and orthodox view.  But there is a
very different view which seems also quite tenable, and which has been
stated with great force by Haldane in <em>Callinicus</em>. It can be
maintained that modern warfare is less horrible than the warfare of
pre-scientific times; that bombs are probably more merciful than
bayonets; that lachrymatory gas and mustard gas are perhaps the most
humane weapons yet devised by military science; and that the orthodox
view rests solely on loos-thinking sentimentalism. It may also by
urged (though this was not one of Haldane’s theses) that the
equalization of risks which science was expected to bring would be in
the long range salutary; that a civilian’s life is not worth more than
a soldier’s, nor a woman’s more than a man’s; that anything is better
than the concentration of savagery on one particular class; and that,
in short, the sooner war comes ‘all out’ the better.</p>

<p>I do not know which of these views is nearer to the truth. It is
an urgent and a moving question, but I need not argue it here. It
concerns only the ‘trivial’ mathematics, which it would be
Hogben’s business to defend rather than mine. The cases for his
mathematics may be rather more than a little soiled; the case for
mine is unaffected.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is more to be said, since there is one purpose at any
rate which the real mathematics may serve in war. When the world is
mad, a mathematician may find in mathematics an incomparable anodyne.

<h2 id="main-topics-for-review">Main Topics for Review</h2>

<p>Today we review the topics that we learned after Exam 1 with the
exception of number theory (which will not be included in Exam
2).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>State Machines and how to argue about correctness of programs.</p></li>

<li><p>Recursive Definitions and how to prove statements about them using structural induction.</p></li>

<li><p>Infinite Sets and Cardinalities, and how to show sets are finite, infinite, countable, or uncountable.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="state-machines">State Machines</h2>

<p>$M = (S, G \subset S \times S, q_0 \in S)$ defines a state machine.</p>

<p>$P$ is a <em>preserved invariant</em> if:
$$ \forall q \in S. (P(q) \wedge (q \rightarrow r) \in G) \implies P&reg;$$</p>

<p><strong>Invariant Principle:</strong> If $P$ is a <em>preserved invariant</em> and
  $P(q_0)$ is true, then property $P$ is true for all <strong>reachable
  states</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="proving-program-correctness">Proving Program Correctness</h2>

<p>To prove a program $R$ produces the correct output:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Model it as a state machine, $M$.</p></li>

<li><p>Show that $M$ eventually terminates.</p></li>

<li><p>Show partial correctness:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a suitable preserved invariant $P$ for $M$.</li>
<li>Show that $P(q)$ for all final states implies the output correctness property. (Final states are states where the execution terminates.)</li>
<li>Show $P(q_0)$ &mdash; the perserved invariant holds for the start state.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<!--page-->

<h2 id="recursive-data-types">Recursive Data Types</h2>

<p>To define a recursive data type $D$:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Define one or more <strong>base</strong> objects, $d \in D$.</p></li>

<li><p>Define one or more <strong>constructor</strong> cases that specify how to construct a new object $d \in D$ from one or more previoulsy-constructed objects, $d_1, d_2, \ldots \in D$.</p></li>

<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>

<p><a href="/ps/ps8"><strong>Problem Set 8</strong></a> is due <strong>Friday at 6:29pm</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday&rsquo;s class</strong> will include a review for Exam 2.  Before 6:59pm
  Monday, send to <a href="mailto:uvacs2102staff@gmail.com"><em>uvacs2102staff@gmail.com</em></a> topics you would like to review. We will have a similar rule to Exam 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fewer than 10 total requests: it means, class is not being sufficiently challenged and we should be doing more difficult material (except for the 10 requestors who get exam exemptions).</li>
<li>Exactly 10 total requests: all requestors get automatic exam exemptions, review requested topics.</li>
<li>More than 10 requests implies we should spend Thursday’s class on reviewing requested topics, no exam exemptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exam-2">Exam 2</h3>

<p>Exam 2 will be in class on Thursday, 9 Nov.  You can get a good
idea for what to expect on Exam 2 based on Exam 1, and also by looking at the <a href="/docs/practiceexam2.pdf">Practice Exam
2</a> (from last year&rsquo;s class). We strongly
encourage you to try to problems on your own, before looking at the
<a href="/docs/practiceexam2-solutions.pdf">posted solutions</a>. The main difference is that this year, we did not cover the topic of &ldquo;stable marriage&rdquo;, but the our exam 2 will also cover the topic of infinities (i.e. infinite sets, countable and uncountable sets, etc.) as well.</p>

<p><strong>Resources.</strong> Similarly to Exam 1, you will be permitted to use a <em>single paper page</em> of
notes that you prepare and bring to the exam.  It is fine to
collaborate with others to prepare your notes.  The page should be no
larger than a US Letter size page ($8.5 \times 11$ inches), and you
may write (or print) on both sides of the page.  You may not use any
special devices (e.g., magnifying glasses) to read your page. No other
resources, other than your own brain, body, and writing instrument,
are permitted during the exam.</p>

<p><strong>Content.</strong> The problems on the exam will cover material from Classes
  1&ndash;19, Problem Sets 1&ndash;8 (including the provided solutions), and the relevant material from MCS
  Chapters 1&ndash;8. However, only one problem will be about the material covered by Exam 1, and the rest will be on the material we covered since Exam 1 (namely, classes 13-19, problem sets 6&ndash;8, and chapters 6,7,8).  Everything on the exam will be something you have seen
  in at least two of these (Classes, Problem Sets, and MCS Book), and
  most of the exam will be things you have seen in all three.  If you
  understand the problems on the problem sets and questions on the class
  notes well enough to be able to answer similar questions, you should
  do well on the exam.</p>

<p>Simiarly to Exam 1, for most students, we believe the best way to prepare for the exam
will be to (1) go over the problem sets and their solutions, and make
sure you understand well any of the problems you did not get before;
(2) go through the provided practice exam and try to solve all the
problems on your own before reading the solutions; (3) go through the
questions in the class notes and convince yourself you can answer them
well; (4) re-read chapters of the book, solving the associated
practice problems, especially for any sections on topics where you had
difficulty on the problem sets.  If you do #1 and #2 and understand
well the problems on the practice exam, you should be confident you&rsquo;ll
do well on the exam; if you struggled on the problem sets, you would
benefit from doing #3 and #4 as well.</p>

<h2 id="divisibility">Divisibility</h2>

<p>Number theory is a study of integers $\mathbb{Z}={0,-1,1,-2,2,\dots}$. Adding, multiplying, and negating, are 3 operators on integers that we can define in a straight-forward way. Dividing is more tricky. For that, we first define the notation $a \mid b$ to denote the simpler situation where $b = k \cdot a$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. In this case, we say that $a$ is a <em>divisor</em> of $b$ and that $b$ is a <em>multiple</em> of $a$.</p>

<p>Show that if we assume $a \mid b$ and $a \mid c$ (for any integers $a,b,c$), then for all integers $x,y$ it will hold that $a \mid xa + yb$.</p>

<p>#</p>

<p>When   $b$ is \emph{not} a multiple of $a$, we can still have some form of division, stated in the following theorem.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem [Division Theorem]</strong> For all integers $n,d$, there are integers $q$ (called the quotiont) and $r$ (called the remainder, denoted by $rem(m,d)$) such that
$$n = q \cdot d + r \text{<del>and</del>}  0\leq r &lt; |d|.$$
Note that the remainder, as defined here, is always non-negative. For example when dividing $-3$ by $5$ we get $q=-1$ and $r=2$.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> A <em>prime</em> $p$, is an integer $p&gt;1$ such that  $1$ and $p$ are the only positive divisors of $p$. Other $n&gt;1$ numbers (that are not prime) are called composite.</p>

<p>The following well-known  theorem can be proved by strong induction on $n$.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem [Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]</strong>. Any $n&gt;1$ has a unique represention in the following form:
$$ n = p_1^{a_1} \dots p_k^{a_k}$$
where $p<em>i &lt; p</em>{i+1}$ and $p_i$ is prime for all $i$.</p>

<p>Hint for proof: Use strong induction on $n$, and try to show that any two different representations for $n$ will have the same `smallest&rsquo; prime $p_1$ and the same power $a_1$ for $p_1$.</p>

<h2 id="easy-to-state-but-hard-to-solve-problems">Easy-to-state, but hard-to-solve problems</h2>

<p>In number theory, we can easily state problems that are super hard to solve. These are some examples.</p>

<p><strong>Goldbach&rsquo;s conjecture:</strong> Any even integer $n&gt;2$ can be written as $n=p+q$ where $p,q$ are both primes. The conjecture is still open, though we know that it is correct for all $n \leq 10^{18}$.</p>

<p><strong>Twin prime&rsquo;s conjecture:</strong> There infinite prime numbers $p$ where $p+2$ is also prime. Note that we cannot `check the conjecture up to $n$&rsquo; anymore! And it is still open&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem:</strong> For any integer $n&gt;2$ there are no integers $a,b,c$ where $a^n + b^n = c^n$. Note that for $n=2$ there are integer solutions like $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$. Fermat claimed to have a proof, but nobody knows if he really did or not. Andrew Wiles eventually proved this in 1994, hence we call it a <em>theorem</em> and not a conjecture anymore.</p>

<h2 id="greatest-common-divisor">Greatest Common Divisor</h2>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> For natural numbers $m,n&gt;0$ we call $d&gt;0$ their \emph{greatest common divisor}, denoted by $d=gcd(m,n)$ if $d$ is the largest number such that $d \mid m$ and $d \mid n$. (Make sure to verify why we can always say that such $d$ exists.)</p>

<p>We can use the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, to <em>compute</em> the gcd of any given pairs of integers. But how efficient is it? The problem is that factoring numbers $m,n$ into their prime factors is not something we know how to do efficiently. In particular, no known algorithm is guaranteed to factor all numbers with $1000,000$ digits in less than an (estimated) thousand years! The conjecture is that no such `efficient&rsquo; algorithm exists, and many cryptographic algorithms <em>assume</em> this is the case!</p>

<h2 id="euclid-s-algorithm">Euclid&rsquo;s Algorithm</h2>

<p>Despite not knowing how to factor integers efficiently, Euclid showed how to find gcd quite efficiently. This shows, even if the most ``natural&rdquo; algorithm fails for doing something efficiently, we should always consider the possibility that an alternative way could still exist.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def Euclid_gcd(m, n):
   while n &gt; 0:
      r = rem(m,n)
      m = n
      n = r
   return m
</code></pre>

<p>What is a good state machine modeling the behavior of Euclid&rsquo;s algorithm?</p>

<p>Suppose $d$ is any integer (in particular, it could be the gcd of the original state $(m,n)$ of the state machine for Eclid&rsquo;s algorithm). Show that $gcd(a,b)=d$ is a preserved invariant for the transition graph of this state machine. Namely, if we go from one state to another state, the gcd does not change.</p>

<p>#</p>

<p>If the Euclid&rsquo;s algorithm ends, at the very last step we will have $n=0$ which means $m$ is indeed the right gcd for that particular (final) state. Together with the preserved invariant (that you proved above), argue that the program has \emph{partial correctness}. Namely: if it ends, it outputs correctly.</p>

<p>#</p>

<p>Now prove the termination. Namely, show that the Euclid&rsquo;s gcd algorithm will always end. Hint, look at $a+b$ for any state $(a,b)$ that we are in, and show that it always
decreases.</p>

<p>#</p>

<p>Amazing thing about Euclid&rsquo;s algorithm is that it is indeed quite efficient. A better analysis shows that it will always terminate in $\log (m+n)$ steps. (Hint: show that after two steps, $m$ will be at most <em>half</em> of what it was before..)
