<p>A <em>state machine</em>, $M = (S, G: S \times S, q_0 \in S)$, is a binary
relation (called a <em>transition relation</em>) on a set (both the domain and
codomain are the same set).  One state, denoted $q_0$, is designated as
the <em>start state</em>.</p>

<p>An <em>execution</em> of a state machine $M = (S, G \subseteq S \times S, q_0
\in S)$ is a (possibly infinite) sequence of states, $(x_0, x_1, \cdots,
x_n)$ where (1) $x_0 = q_0$ (it begins with the start state), and (2)
$\forall i \in {0, 1, \ldots, n - 1} \ldotp (x<em>i, x</em>{i + 1}) \in G$
(if $q$ and $r$ are consecutive states in the sequence, then there is an
edge $q \rightarrow r$ in $G$).</p>

<p>A state $q$ is <em>reachable</em> if it appears in some execution.</p>

<p>A <em>preserved invariant</em> of a state machine $M = (S, G \subseteq S \times

<h1 id="invariant-principle">Invariant Principle</h1>

<p>An <em>execution</em> of a state machine $M = (S, G \subseteq S \times S, q_0 \in S)$ is a (possibly infinite) sequence of states, $(x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_n)$ where:</p>

<li>$\forall i \in {0, 1, \ldots, n - 1} \ldotp (x<em>i, x</em>{i + 1}) \in G$ (if $q$ and $r$ are consecutive states in the sequence, then there is an edge $q \rightarrow r$ in $G$)</li>
</ol>

<p>A state $q$ is <em>reachable</em> if it appears in some execution.  (That is,
there is a sequence of transitions starting from $q_0$, following edges
in $G$, that ends with $q$.)</p>

<p>$$
M_1 = (S = \mathbb{N}, G = {(x, y) | y = x^2 }, q_0 = 1)
$$
$$
M_2 = (S = \mathbb{N}, G = {(x, y) | \exists k \in \mathbb{N} \ldotp y = kx }, q_0 = 1)
$$</p>

<p>Which states are <em>reachable</em> for $M_1$ and $M_2$?</p>

<p>#</p>

<p>A <em>preserved invariant</em> of a state machine $M = (S, G \subseteq S \times
S, q_0 \in S)$ is a predicate, $P$, on states, such that whenever $P(q)$
is true of a state $q$, and $q \rightarrow r \in G$, then $P&reg;$ is
true.</p>

<p><strong>Invariant Principle.</strong> If a <em>preserved invariant</em> of a state machine
  is true for the start state, it is true for all reachable states.</p>

<p>To show $P(q)$ for machine $M = (S, G \subseteq S \times S, q_0 \in
  S)$ all $q \in S$, show:</p>

<ol>
<li>Base case: $P(\fillin)$</li>
<li>$\forall s \in S \ldotp \fillin \implies \fillin$</li>
</ol>

<p>Show the invariant principle holds using the principle of induction
(hint: induction is on the <em>number of steps</em>).</p>

    <p class="fronthead"><a href="https://uvacs2102.github.io/challenge5/">Three-Clause Challenge Refuted!</a> (Fri, 30 Sep 2016)</p>
     <p>Challenge 5 has been refuted by Henry Spece!</p>

<p><div class="highlightg">
<strong>Challenge 5.</strong> (From <a href="https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/e0b17949-c94c-466b-835a-196381f3f911/ps3_solutions.pdf">PS3 Solutions</a>) Prove that the four-clause solution given for question 6 is the shortest possible equivalent 3CNF formula.
   </div></p>

<p>The challenge as stated was actually bogus!  The four-clause solution
isn&rsquo;t the shortest possible equivalent 3CNF formula.  Henry found a
three-clause equivalent 3CNF formula, and proved that there is no
two-clause equivalent 3CNF formula.</p>

<p>His answer is below:</p>

<p><blockquote>
The four-clause 3-CNF equivalent solution to the logical equation is not
the smallest equivalent solution to the equation.</p>

<p>The following is the original formula: <em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or; <em>C</em> &or; (&not;<em>D</em> &and; <em>E</em>).<br />
Here is a two-clause solution: (<em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or;
&not;<em>x</em>) &and; (<em>x</em> &or; <em>C</em>&or; &not;<em>D</em>) &and; (<em>x</em> &or; <em>C</em> &or; <em>E</em>).</p>

<p>This can be shown to be equivalent to the original formula by
constraining <em>x</em> to be <em>A</em>&or;&not;<em>B</em> and algebraically reducing:
   <blockquote>
(<em>A</em>&or;&not;<em>B</em>&or;&not;(<em>A</em>&or;&not;<em>B</em>))&and;(<em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or; <em>C</em>
&or; &not;<em>D</em>)&and;(<em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or; <em>C</em> &or; <em>E</em>)<br />
(<em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or; <em>C</em> &or; &not;<em>D</em>)&and;(<em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or; <em>C</em> &or; <em>E</em>)<br />
(<em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or; <em>C</em>) &or; (&not;<em>D</em>&and;<em>E</em>)<br />
<em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or; <em>C</em> &or; (&not;<em>D</em>&and;<em>E</em>)
   </blockquote></p>

<p>To further prove the equivalence, we can make the original formula
unsatisfied and show that there is no satisfying assignment for <em>x</em>.  To
be unsatisfied, <em>A</em> must be <strong>F</strong>, <em>B</em> must be <strong>T</strong>, and <em>C</em> must be
<strong>F</strong>.  This reduces the formula to:
   <blockquote>
(<strong>F</strong> &or; <strong>F</strong> &or; &not;<em>x</em>)&and;(x &or; <strong>F</strong> &or; &not;<em>D</em>)&and;(x &or; <strong>F</strong> &or; <em>E</em>)
   </blockquote>
Because of the first term, <em>x</em> must be <strong>F</strong> if we want to satisfy the formula:
   <blockquote>
(<strong>F</strong> &or; <strong>F</strong> &or; <strong>T</strong>)&and;(<strong>F</strong> &or; <strong>F</strong> &or; &not;<em>D</em>)&and;(<strong>F</strong> &or; <strong>F</strong> &or; <em>E</em>) &equiv; (&not;<em>D</em>&and;<em>E</em>)
   </blockquote>
This has the same satisfiability as the remaining variables in the original formula (if &not;<em>D</em>&and;<em>E</em> is not satisfied, there is no satisfying assignment for <em>x</em>).</p>

<p><em>Proof that this is the shortest possible solution:</em> There is no two or
one clause solution because a new variable in addition to <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>,
D, and <em>E</em> is required for each clause to have only three terms, and
this variable must be repeated (by the rules we use to select that
variable).  Therefore, only 5 variables may be represented in a
two-clause solution, while there are at least six variables required for
equivalence to the original formula.</p>

<p><em>Proof that a new variable is required:</em> The original formula reduces to
(<em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or; <em>C</em> &or; &not;<em>D</em>)&and;(<em>A</em> &or; &not;<em>B</em> &or;
<em>C</em> &or; <em>E</em>) in CNF form, which has two clauses, each containing a
unique combination of four variables.  There is no way to reduce the
number of variables per clause of a solution without adding a variable,
therefore at least one variable must be added to form the 3-CNF
equivalent of this formula.</p>

  
    <p class="fronthead"><a href="https://uvacs2102.github.io/anonymousfeedback3/">Anonymous Feedback Comments</a> (Thu, 29 Sep 2016)</p>
     <p>This anonymous comment was submitted through collab:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>A lot of my fellow classmates and I are concerned about this class because we feel that we aren&rsquo;t provided with the resources necessary to be able to do the homework in a reasonable amount of time/effort. So many people spend hours and hours at office hours several times a week but even the TAs don&rsquo;t understand our questions and are not able to help us understand any of the concepts. I understand that we&rsquo;re supposed to be challenged by the class, but if we aren&rsquo;t well-equipped to work through the challenges it becomes extremely frustrating. I feel like the class could be improved if the lectures were better structured so that we&rsquo;re thoroughly taught the concepts and steps we can take to think through a problem rather than going through examples that are hard to understand because we&rsquo;re only copying down things we don&rsquo;t fully understand and that don&rsquo;t apply to other problems we&rsquo;re expected to solve. I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude at all so I apologize if it comes off that way, it&rsquo;s just that so many of the students and I are frustrated and stressed out about how much we don&rsquo;t understand in the class even after seeking help repeatedly.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the drawbacks of anonymous comments, is I have no way to
follow-up to better understand what is really going on here. I do
appreciate the anonymous comments, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be worried about
making comments like this directly &mdash; I view any student making
comments with the goal of improving their own learning and making things
better for the class as a positive thing, and you shouldn&rsquo;t be worried
that I would count any thoughtful and respectful comment against you.</p>

<p>As for the content, as best as I&rsquo;m able to interpret it, the perception
that the problems are too hard does not fit with what I&rsquo;m seeing in the
assignments.  For all of the problem sets so far, more than 90% of
students have received grades at least 5 (the exception was for PS3,
where it was 89%), which means nearly all answers correct (with some
justifications that could be better).  On all the assignments, fewer
than 5% of the submissions have been 4 or below.  So, either we are
grading them too generously and students are getting 5+s without
actually understanding much (which I don&rsquo;t think is the case, but
perhaps we are giving too much benefit of the doubt for unclear
answers), or, more likely, people are acutally understanding things
quite well, but it is taking more &ldquo;pain&rdquo; and effort to get there than
you expect.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to spend time in lecture copying down things you
don&rsquo;t understand.  If there are things you don&rsquo;t understand in lecture,
please stop and ask questions, or if you aren&rsquo;t comfortable doing that,
at least post questions on slack.  If you don&rsquo;t ask questions, I don&rsquo;t
know what is confusing, or what should be explained.  I make the slides
and notes available so you can spend lecture time thinking instead of
writing (that said, I think it is often helpful to write things down
yourself as part of understanding them, or discovering what is unclear).</p>

<p>There are lots of resources available, but I think you are expecting the
wrong kind of problems if you are looking for resources to tell you how
to solve them.  I understand why this is, since it is what you expect
from most of your previous classes.  You were all good students, and
great at redoing things you saw in class, that&rsquo;s why you got into
UVA.</p>

<p>But, you shouldn&rsquo;t expect most problems from now on (in this class, and
in any worthwhile classes you take after this one) to be like
this. You&rsquo;re not learning anything (useful), if you are just re-solving
problems you&rsquo;ve already seen, or making straightforward symbol
replacements in them.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the problems you did in previous math classes were
problems you could type into Wolfram Alpha and it could solve instantly;
this isn&rsquo;t surprising - if a problem is something you can solve by
following given rules in a straightforward way, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a
problem for humans to spend time on, the rules should be encoded in
programs that can do it automatically.  Sometimes its worthwhile for
humans to learn what the rules are and get some experience following
them, but the further along you get, and the more advanced computing
systems get, the more ridiculous it is for humans to spend tons of time
learning to do things computers already do well.</p>

<p>So, we do learn steps for solving problems in this class, both in
lecture and in the book.  And, all of the problems on the problem sets
are related to things you learn in class.  But, many of the problems
also involve some creative step that isn&rsquo;t a straightforward replication
of something you&rsquo;ve seen in class or the book. Without that, I wouldn&rsquo;t
really see the point in assigning them - I&rsquo;m not assigning problem sets
to check if you are doing the reading and coming to class, the point of
the problem sets is to develop your understanding of the concepts by
having you figure out how to apply them in new ways that go beyond
things you&rsquo;ve already seen and (more importantly) to develop your
abilities as mathematical thinkers and problem solvers.  You can&rsquo;t do
that by replicating problems you&rsquo;ve already done, or by solving problems
that are straightforward repetitions of problems you&rsquo;ve already seen
solved.  But, before trying to solve new problems, you should make sure
you understand the examples you&rsquo;ve seen in the book and in class. It is
usually much harder to come up with your own solutions to problems than
to understand ones that are provided by others.</p>

<p>All that said, I would encourage anyone who feels like they are spending
an unreasonable amount of time on this, or feeling frustrated and
stressed out by it, to come to office hours to talk to me (or to make an
appointment if you can&rsquo;t make it then).  My office hours have mostly
been fairly empty, and the best sense I get of what is going on in the
class is from students who come to talk to me during office hours, so I
hope you&rsquo;ll do that rather than just getting frustrated.</p>

<h2 id="well-ordering-principle">Well-Ordering Principle</h2>

<p>Remember the well-ordering principle template from Class 3:</p>

<p>To prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define the set of counterexamples, $C ::= { n \in \mathbb{N} | NOT(P(n)) }$.</li>
<li>Assume for contradiction that $C$ is non-empty.</li>
<li>By the well-ordering principle, there must be some smallest element, $m \in C$.</li>
<li>Reach a contradiction (this is the creative part!).  One way to reach a contradiction would be to show $P(m)$.  Another way is to show there must be an element $m&rsquo; \in C$ where $m&rsquo; &lt; m$.</li>
<li>Conclude that $C$ must be empty, hence there are no counter-examples and $P(n)$ always holds.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since we didn&rsquo;t finish the winning strategy proof in class, I&rsquo;ve written
it out fully here.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Player 1 has a winning strategy in Take-Away if
  the number of sticks, $n$ is not divisible by 4.</p>

<p>For any induction proof, the first thing we need to do is write the
theorem as a predicate on the natural numbers.</p>

<p>$$\forall n \in \mathbb{N} \ldotp P(n) ::= \textrm{ Player 1 has a winning strategy if }\exists a \in { 1, 2, 3 }, \exists k \in \mathbb{N} \textrm{ such that } n = 4k + a.$$</p>

<p><em>Base cases</em>: $P(1)$, $P(2)$, $P(3)$.</p>

<p>$P(1)$: If there is $1$ stick remaining, Player 1 wins by taking 1 stick.<br />
$P(2)$: If there are $2$ sticks remaining, Player 1 wins by taking 2 sticks.<br />
$P(3)$: If there are $3$ sticks remaining, Player 1 wins by taking 3 sticks.</p>

<p><em>Inductive case</em>: Using strong induction, $\forall m \in \mathbb{N}, m \ge 4 \ldotp (\forall k \in \mathbb{N}, k \le m. P(k)) \implies P(m + 1)$.</p>

<p>Since $m \ge 4$ we can write $m = 4k + b$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}^{+}$ and $b \in {0, 1, 2, 3}$.</p>

<p>We consider four cases for each value of $b$.</p>

<p>Case 3: $b = 3$.  Since $m = 4k + 3$, $m + 1 = 4k + 4 = 4(k + 1)$.
Since $m + 1$ is divisible by 4, $P(m+ 1)$ holds because the predicate
makes no claims when $n$ is divisible by 4.</p>

<p>Cases 0, 1, 2: Since $m = 4k + b$ for $b \in {0, 1, 2}$, we know $m +
1 = 4k + c$ for $c \in {1, 2, 3}$ (since $c = b + 1$ to produce $m +
1$).  We need to show $P(m+1)$, which means showing that player 1 has a
winning strategy for $n = 4k + c$, $c \in {1, 2, 3}$.  Player 1 takes
$c$ sticks, leaving $4k$ sticks.</p>

<p>For the next turn, Player 2 can remove 1, 2, or 3 sticks, leaving $4k -
d$ sticks, $d \in {1, 2, 3}$.  This can be simplified to $4(k - 1) +
e$ sticks where $e = 4 - d$ since $4k - 4 + (4 - d) = 4k - d = 4(k -
1) + e$.  Hence, after Player 2&rsquo;s turn it will be Player 1&rsquo;s turn with
$4(k - 1) + e$ sticks, $e \in {1, 2, 3}$.  We know $4(k - 1) + e &lt; m$
and it is not divisible by 4.  So, Player 1 has a winning strategy from
$P(m + 1)$ since she has a move to make such that no matter what move
player 2 makes, it leads to a number that is not divisible by 4 and is
less than $m$, which we know is a position where Player 1 has a winning
strategy but strong induction.</p>

<p>Note that $4(k - 1) + e$ is $m - 1$, $m - 2$ or $m - 3$, so we need to
know $m \ge 4$ for this to be valid.  That&rsquo;s why we needed three base
cases!</p>

     <p>The solutions and comments for PS4 are now posted in collab: <a href="https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/e0b17949-c94c-466b-835a-196381f3f911/ps4_solutions.pdf">PDF</a></p>

<p>You should find your graded assignment as a new PDF attachment with
markup on it in collab (if you submitted with teammates, please check
with your partners).</p>

<p>The meaning of the scores is the same as for previous problem sets.  A
score of 6 means you got everything we expected out of this assignment,
and 5 means you did well for the most part by had some answers that
should have been better.  Scores above 6 are reserved for excellent work
that is above expectations.  (In the gradebook, collab sometimes shows
the grades scaled by 100 for some buggy reason.  Although receiving a
score of 100+ is possible in theory, no one received more than 8 points
for this assingment.  If you see a score about 100, the meaning is that
score divided by 100.)</p>
