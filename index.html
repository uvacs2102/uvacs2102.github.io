    <p class="fronthead"><a href="https://uvacs2102.github.io/surveyquestions2/">Survey Questions (Part 2)</a> (Sat, 10 Sep 2016)</p>
     <p>Here are my (in progress) responses to more questions submitted in the
registration surveys (see <a href="/surveyquestions">Part 1</a> for the first set
of responses).  Sorry its taking a long time to answer these questions,
but there are lots of great questions submitted, and I will eventually
get to them all.</p>

<p><div class="question">
How to get better
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Practice! (This applies to pretty much everything).  But, its important
to practice in a way that maximimizes benefit and avoids getting stuck
in local maxima.  The best kind of practice involves honest and direct
feedback, and interaction with people at both levels above and levels
below yourself.  We hope the problem sets in this class will provide
plenty of opportunity for effective practice.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
The syllabus said that students who do exceptionally well will be offered positions in your research group. I am interested in encryption research and I was wondering what I would have to do to be considered for a position in your research group.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Excellent!  Thanks for reading to the end of the syllabus.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to consider anyone who expresses interest for a summer
position in my research group, but want to try and have a good
expectation that it will be a positive and worthwhile experience for
both of us before offering a position.  The main things I want to see
are <em>curiosity</em> and <em>initiative</em>.  Beyond that, it does help to show
that you can do well on the content in the class, but it is not
necessary to be the best student or to do consistently well.  Much more
valuable to do one impressive thing (which could be something in the
class like solving a challenge problem, or something you&rsquo;ve done on your
own, like building an interesting mobile app or writing a blog, etc.).
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
I would like to learn everything I would need to know to be able to build big programs.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
This class is more relevant for building <em>small</em> programs that do a lot,
than for building <em>big</em> programs.</p>

<p>The main challenge in building big programs is managing complexity and
the best tool for managing complexity is to define clean and limited
interfaces between components.  This class might help some for that, at
least in terms of the underlying skills, becuase it should improve your
ability to think clearly about precise definitions and to strive for
minimal requirements.</p>

<p>If you want to learn how to build big programs successfully the best
thing to do is to actually try building progressively bigger programs,
and to join and contribute to open source projects where you&rsquo;ll get
mentoring from people with experience building (and maintaining, which
is often the hardest part!) big programs.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
I love interesting classes, but I also get really stressed about
grades. They don&rsquo;t matter as much as I have been told they do, but my
mind is conditioned to value them. I just hope this class will be more
interesting than stressful! The article we just had to read definitely
fell into interesting and I would have enjoyed that on my own.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
When you were in high school, you were probably told that grades were
essential to getting into a good college, and you followed this advice
well and were smart enough to do well, that&rsquo;s how you ended up at UVA.</p>

<p>In college, grades have much less significance.  There is,
unfortunately, one exception to that which is getting into the CS
majors.  I hope this will change, and also encourage students to not
accept being turned away from their desired major without a fight, but
for now the unfortunate reality is that slots in the CS majors have been
capped, and admissions are decided nearly entirely based on arbitrary
GPA cut-offs.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there is very little that depends on your college grades (as
long as they are respectable enough that you don&rsquo;t run into trouble with
academic probation or anything like that).</p>

<p>If you want to go to graduate school (in computing, at least) after
college, it is a little better to have great grades than to have
mediocre grades (although perfect or near-perfect grades will probably
count against you), but far more important to have an impressive
accomplishment and reference letters.  Being a significant author on a
research paper is the most important determiner in getting into the best
PhD programs, and having letters from known researchers who can provide
a lot of detail about interesting and impressive things you have done is
the next most important thing.  Most reviewers of PhD applications won&rsquo;t
even look at grades, or GPAs, except to possible check grades in a few
key courses, and if the reason for getting poor grades in some less
important classes is that you were more focused on doing some exciting
research, so much the better!</p>

<p>If you want a software development job in industry, there are some
(mostly big, old) companies that will have GPA cut-offs in their hiring
searches, but generally the more interesting and worthwhile the company
you are seeking to work for, the less they care about grades and the
more they want to see evidence of what you can accomplish on your own
initiative.  Contributing significantly to an open source project,
building your own interesting web/mobile app, initiating and leading a
student club, providing a technical and leadership contribution to a
service organization, etc., are all much more impressive and meaningful
evidence that you would be a valuable employee for most companies and
any number of As in your classes.</p>

<p>As for what we can do in cs2102, I do try to make things less stressful
for students, but sometimes things intended to reduce stress are
misinterpreted and actually increase student stress.  I believe being
somewhat vague about what is expected and how grading is done is highly
beneficial for learning.  My favorite quote about this is from John
Stigloe (who was a professor at Harvard, but it applies equally to UVA
students):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This generation of students got into Harvard by doing exactly and precisely what teacher wants. If teacher is vague about what he wants, they work a lot harder to figure out what they want and whether or not it is good. The vaguer the directions, the more likely the opportunity for serendipity to happen. It drives them nuts!</em> (Harvard Professor John Stilgoe on &ldquo;60 Minutes&rdquo;, 4 January 2004)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, I understand that uncertainty is one of the main things that
causes stress for students (and I don&rsquo;t really want to drive students
nuts!).  I hope students will view the vagueness in my courses as
meaning there are many and varried opportunities to show that you
deserve an A in the class, and that I can be trusted to treat everyone
fairly.</p>

<p>The other main cause of grading stress, I believe, is students fearing
that even though they understand the material well and are putting in a
solid effort, that they are at risk of getting less-than-desired grade
because of making little mistakes.  Grading done where each question is
&ldquo;out of&rdquo; some number of points, and there are various ways to lose
specific numbers of points for making mistakes, and the grade is
computed as the total of all the points over all the questions,
exaccerbates this stress in two ways.</p>

<p>First, it means students are mostly focused on getting to the threshold
&ldquo;full credit&rdquo; answer and fearful of anything that might cause point
deductions.  This stifles creativity and ambition.</p>

<p>Second, over the course of a set of assignments, it means it is nearly
impossible to recover from one misstep.  If 90% is needed for an &ldquo;A&rdquo;
grade, it takes 3 grades of 95 to make up for one 75, and 5 grades of 95
to make up for one 65.  With the grading system I use, one great
assignment (or one successful challenge solution), is enough to make up
for several poor assignments.  I&rsquo;m looking for evidence that students
have understood important concepts and shown that they can use them
effectively, not for signs of occasional slip-ups.</p>

<p>I hope students find the grading systems I use to be less stressful, and
more conducive to ambition and creativity.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
People tell me if discrete doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me I will not do well in the class. What can I do to make it &ldquo;click&rdquo;?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I don&rsquo;t think anything worthwhile for you to learn &ldquo;clicks&rdquo; right away.
Usually when something &ldquo;clicks&rdquo;, it is because of lots of struggling and
effort beforehand, setting up your mind for the &ldquo;click&rdquo; to happen.</p>

<p>So, the main thing I would say is don&rsquo;t be distressed if you see other
people getting things more quickly than you do.  Its probably not
because they have some magic discrete math gene that enables them to
understand things that you are lacking.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure no such gene
exists.  Instead, when someone learns something quickly it is probably
because they had a lot of previous experience that gave them the context
necessary for the new concept to make sense.</p>

<p>When things seem overly hard to learn, instead of getting frustrated,
your goal should be to figure out what context you are missing that is
making it hard to learn.  Rather than getting stuck on the new concept,
go back to the previous ones that it is building on and make sure you
really understand them (a great way to do this is to try and explain
them to someone else who might be confused on them).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t just assume you understand things because you can read solutions
to problems and they seem to make sense, make sure you do by working out
the problems yourself and then comparing them to others&rsquo; solutions.  The
collaboration policy for the assignments in this class is intended to
encourage this, and I hope students will take advantage of it, and use
opportunities to work with others as ways to improve each other&rsquo;s
understanding.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
Will this course be focused solely on mathematical proofs, or a broad range of proofs (i.e. Evaluating conspiracy claims)?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
We will concentrate on proofs about mathematical propositions, with a
focus on ones that are (at least loosely) relevant to computing.  The
nice thing about mathematical propositions and proofs is that they can
be stated precisely and umambiguously, and the methods of reasoning are
well established and universal.  Many of the reasoning methods we&rsquo;ll see
for mathematical proofs are also relevant to discussions about things in
the physical world, but the &ldquo;rules of evidence&rdquo; and methods of reasoning
are much less clear and much in dispute (e.g., outright lying seems to
have become pretty much acceptable in our current political discourse,
but assuming any falsehood would completely invalidate any mathematical
proof).  I would encourage everyone to take a philosophy class to look
more deeply at how formal reasoning can be used to understand things in
the real world, but for this class we will mostly stay in the safe world
of mathematical abstractions.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
As a double major in Math and CS, I am also taking the Transition to Higher Mathematics course this semester. Do you believe these proof-based courses would work in conjunction?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I would expect so!  I&rsquo;m sure there will be lots of connections between
the two classes, and would encourage you to share any extra insights you
get with me and the class.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
whats your middle name
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I provide that only on a &ldquo;need-to-know&rdquo; basis.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
How much of a computer/computing/etc. background do I need to succeed in this class?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
You are expected to have at least some programming experience (enough to
understand and write simple programs), and I also assume everyone in the
modern world has had a lot of experience using complex computing
systems.  I think some parts of the class will probably have more
relevance to people with more programming experience, and I&rsquo;ll try to
relate some of the abstract concepts in the class to things that some
students may have encountered in programming (but others will not have
yet seen), but it is not necessary to have substantial computing
background to do well in this class.</p>

<p>The only official prerequisite is cs11xx or equivalent, so if it seems
like anything is ever unfairly assuming more CS background than you
should expect to have by satisfying that prerequisite, you should make
sure to let me know. </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
Is there any actual coding involved in the course?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Its possible there will be some problems that involve programming, but
it will not be a major part of the course.  There will be challenge and
optional problems that might be infeasible to solve without programming.</p>

<p>It will definitely be possible to earn an A in the class without doing
any programming.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
I always enjoy hearing about the instructor&rsquo;s life/achievements. I feel like it makes them seem more human ,and also makes me feel excited to learn under such a distinguished person in their field.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Wow, that&rsquo;s flattering!  (I&rsquo;m not sure if it is more flattering to seem
human, or to be a &ldquo;distinguished person&rdquo;, but either way, I appreciate
the question.)</p>

<p>As for my life, it is mostly focused around my children (a four-year old
daughter, and 17-month old son).  Since having children, I view any
professional accomplishment as inconsequential compared to my hopes of
being a good parent and raising decent and fulfilled children.</p>

<p>As for my achievements and experiences in computing and teaching, the
ones I think are most significant are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When I was an undergraduate at MIT, I was an undergraduate researcher
in Marc Raibert&rsquo;s robotics lab where I worked on making
physically-realistic animations of kangaroo-like creatures.  One day
Prof. Raibert came into the lab and told us we should make the
creatures look like dinosaurs instead, but he couldn&rsquo;t explain why.  A
few weeks later he came back from a meeting with people in Hollywood,
saying he thought he had convinced them it would be possible to make a
sufficiently realistic animated dinosaur for a movie (which turned out
to be Jurassic Park).  As an undergraduate, I also had an opportunity
to work as an intern in John Backus&rsquo; group at IBM Almaden, on a
functional programming language.  John was a UVA dropout, who had gone
on to lead the Fortan project at IBM, develop what is now known as
Backus-Naur Form, and then lead a programming language research group
at IBM Almaden.</p></li>

<li><p>The main research I did as a graduate student at MIT (which didn&rsquo;t end
up actually as part of my PhD dissertation) was to develop a tool for
lightweight static checking, that would take advantage of annotations
added to C programs to be able to warn programmers about likely
programming errors.  The tool I mostly built ended up being quite
widely used, and included in many Linux distributions.  (The work was
mostly done in 1993-1996, with some more doing after I came to UVA in
1999-2001, but I still get bug reports form people using <a href="http://www.splint.org/">the
tool</a>.  Some of the ideas we had for checking
memory use in C programs are now being used, in farily similar form,
in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust programming language</a>,
although I have no direct involvement in this.)</p></li>

<li><p>One of my first goals after starting at UVA (where I joined as a
professor in 1999) was to develop a new introductory computing course
targeted for College of Arts and Sciences students and intended for
people who were only expected to take one computing course.  This
started as a <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pubs/teachingfellowship.pdf">University Teaching Fellowship
Proposal</a>,
and the first course was offered as <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs200-spring2002/">cs200: _Computer Science from Ada
and Euclid to Quantum Computing and the World Wide
Web</a> in 2002.
Initially, there were about 20 students in the class, but more than
half of them dropped out after the first problem set which was not
well designed.  But, the remaining 9 students stuck with the class and
over the years it developed.  Since some students who took it wanted
to continue into other computing courses but were not allowed to in
the curriculum we had then, I created a follow-on course (initially
offered as <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs201j-fall2002/">cs201j: Engineering
Software</a>, and
with <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/snakes/">Snakes!</a>),
which could lead into our other CS courses (it counted as what is now
cs2110, and satisfied the prerequisite for cs2150).</p></li>

<li><p>Based on the success of these courses and the quality of students we
were finding in the College, I pushed for creating a CS major that was
open to CLAS students.  In fall 2005, I was given support from my
Department Chair to lead an effort to create a CS degree for the
College, and after putting together a committee to help with this and
designing a curriculum, the Interdisciplinary Major in Comptuer
Science (BACS) degree was approved in 2006, and we graduated our first
three students in 2007.  By the time I stepped down as BACS director,
the BACS had grown to be larger than any other major offered by the
Engineering school.</p></li>

<li><p>I wrote an open textbook based around the cs200/cs150/cs1120 course,
<a href="http://computingbook.org">_Introduction to Computing: Explorations in Language, Logic, and
Machines</a>.  Although it was not widely
adopted, it does have some eager readers and I get occasional emails
from people who have used it as a self-study book.  It also was the
main thing that led to me being recruited by an open education startup
to teach their first course.  (You can read about my experiences as
the first VP of Education for Udacity here: <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2013/02/cs101-one-year-later.html">CS101: One Year
Later</a>, and
my favorite article about this is <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/online-universities-udacity-grand-challenge-david-stavens-dave-evans"><em>Professors without borders: Will
online learning spell the end of
universities?</em></a>, not just because it somehow claims I have &ldquo;Monty Python humour&rdquo;.)</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve had a chance to teach many <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/students/">remarkable
students</a> who have gone on
to do amazing and wonderful things.  Although its always hard to know
how much impact one actually has, one of the joys and privledges of
being a professor is to follow the careers of your students and to
feel like you can claim some credit for them.  Some of the students
who have worked in my research group include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29K7ldNlH6s&amp;feature=youtu.be">Adrienne Porter
Felt</a>
(<a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/computer-science-grad-stands-watch-users-googles-popular-browser">UVAToday</a>

when she was an undergraduate in my research group, and now leads the
Chrome security team at Google), <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/yh33/">Yan

computation for his PhD in my group, and is now a professor at Indiana
University), <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-hacking-your-phone/">Karsten

worked on RFID security for his PhD in my group, and went on to found

<a href="http://www2.eecs.utk.edu/people/faculty/pauln">Nate Paul</a> (who work
on malware security for his PhD in my group, and has gone on to do
work on medical devices and embedded security at Oak Ridge and
University of Tennessee),
and <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/students/">many others</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve led or been involved in research projects that have come up with
some cool ideas, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DsR4PucAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">a few of which have led to lots of other research as
well as use in
industry</a>.
The most significant are our work on making <a href="http://www.mightbeevil.org/">secure multi-party
computation practical</a>, improving
software security (e.g.,
<a href="http://scriptinspector.org/">ScriptInspector</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/perracotta/">Perracotta</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pubs/infosec05.html">PHPrevent</a>,
and <a href="http://www.splint.org">Split</a>), and <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/mcl/">mobile
networking</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been involved in a few start-up companies, one as a co-founder
(when I was a grad student), one as an early employee (with Udacity,
growing from 5 to ~50 people), and many as an advisor.  I&rsquo;ve learned
from these experiences (mostly that academia is much more pleasant
than industry!), but also have lots of opportunites to work with great
people and see different aspects of companies at various stages.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve written a <a href="http://www.dori-mic.org/">baby book on theoretical computer
science</a>, make some <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/videos/#fun">fun
videos</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/2009-02-19-ofa/">received
an award from Tim
Kaine</a> (back when
he was a lowly governor).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope that helps!  Thanks for asking.

    <p class="fronthead"><a href="https://uvacs2102.github.io/ps1comments/">Problem Set 1 Comments</a> (Sat, 10 Sep 2016)</p>
     <p>The solutions and comments for PS1 are now posted in collab: <a href="https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/e0b17949-c94c-466b-835a-196381f3f911/ps1solutions.pdf">PDF</a></p>

<p>The grades will be released soon.  Sorry it took so long to get the
grading and solutions done for PS1.  We are sorting out how to manage
grading using collab and figuring a better way to manage this, and
getting tablets to make it easier to write on your submitted PDFs
(instead of typing notes, as was done for PS1).  I hope this will go
more smoothly for PS2, and be fully worked out for PS3 and later. Our
goal (which I think is reasonable for you to expect) is to always return
assignments within a week of when they are due.</p>

<p>The way problem sets are graded in this class is probably different from
what most of you are accustomed to.  The purpose of the problem sets is
primarily for <em>learning</em> and not for <em>grading</em>, so the grading system I
use is designed with the goals of providing useful feedback to you, as
well as giving us a way to see how the class is going and if students
are on track.  This means instead of giving detailed point scores for
every problem and grading in a way that emphasizes losing points by
making mistakes, the problem sets are graded in a way meant to capture
how well students are understanding the material.</p>

<p>Collab requires specifying a <em>maximum</em> score for each assignment, but
there is no real maximum score, and you should not view the scores as
being &ldquo;<em>n</em> out of <em>m</em>&rdquo; where there is some maximum score and you are losing
points if you end up below that score.</p>

<p>The meaning of the grades for PS1 is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Real problems - only attempted a few problems, and nothing that shows any understanding.</p></li>

<li><p>Substantial problems - attempted a few of the problems, but didn&rsquo;t show any real understanding of many concepts.</p></li>

<li><p>Fundamental problems understanding key concepts; not able to complete
reasonable answers for most questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Several fundamentally incorrect answers, or fundamental problems
understanding difference between inference and equality.</p></li>

<li><p>Nearly all answers correct, but justifications not as strong as
desired.</p></li>

<li><p>All answers acceptable.  (This is the &ldquo;expected&rdquo; score for PS1.)</p></li>

<li><p>All answers essentially correct, with at least one especially good answer.</p></li>

<li><p>All answers well done, and more than one especially good answer.</p></li>

<li><p>Your answers broke new ground in computer science. (Not used for PS1)</p></li>

<li><p>You solved an important open problem! (Not expected to be used in cs2102)</p></li>

<li><p>You deserve a Turing award! (in theory, there is no upper bound on the grading, but I do not expect to have occassion to use grades higher than 11)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Getting the &ldquo;expected&rdquo; code (6 for PS1) on assignments means you are
well on track to getting an A in the class (this is the &ldquo;expected&rdquo; grade
for everyone).  You&rsquo;ll need to do well on the exams, also, of course.</p>

<p>If your score on PS1 is below 6, you should have a good idea from the
comments and from reading the solutions, what you need to improve on to
do better on future assignments.</p>

<p>If you notice a significant error in any of the provided solutions
(where &ldquo;significant&rdquo; is at my discretion, but generally means something
more than an obvious typo), you can earn bonus points by reporting it.</p>

<p><a href="/ps/ps2"><strong>Problem Set 2</strong></a> is due <strong>Friday at 6:29pm</strong>.  A few of the
problems on PS2 are quite challenging!  The problems are organized by
topic, not by difficulty (the hardest problems are #4 and #7).  I hope
everyone makes a good attempt to solve all of the problems, but don&rsquo;t be
overly stressed if you cannot solve these ones and move on to the other
problems if you are stuck on them (to hopefully return to these problems
after you&rsquo;ve had more time to think about them).  Good solutions to
these problems will impress us, but are not necessary to get a good
score on PS2.</p>

<p>I will be out-of-town Monday, and not able to hold my usual office hours
on Monday.  I will have &ldquo;make-up&rdquo; office hours on Wednesday, 3:30-4:30pm
(in addition to my usual Wednesday 1-2pm office hours).</p>

<p><strong>Definition: satisfiable.</strong> A logical formula is <em>satisfiable</em> if there
  is <em>some</em> way to make it <strong>true</strong>.  That is, there is at least one
  assignment of truth value to its variables that makes the forumla
  true.</p>

<p><strong>Definition: conjunctive normal form (CNF).</strong> A logical formula that is
  written as a conjunction of <em>clauses</em>, where each clause is a
  disjunction of <em>literals</em>, and each literal is either a variable or a
  negation of a variable, is in <em>conjunctive normal form</em>.  If each
  clause has excatly three literals, it is called <em>three conjunctive
  normal form</em> (3CNF).</p>

## Notations

Mathematics and other domains often use many symbols to mean the same
thing.  Section 3.2 of the book gives some common notations, but there
are others in common use.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
English & Logic & C, Java, Rust & Python \\ \hline
$P$ \smallcaps{implies} $Q$ & $P \implies Q$ {\em or} $P \longrightarrow Q$ & - & - \\
\smallcaps{not}$(P)$ & $\neg P$ {\em or} $\overline{P}$ & \verb+!p+ & \verb+not p+ \\
$P$ \smallcaps{and} $Q$ & $P \wedge Q$ & \verb+p && q+ & \verb+p and q+ \\
$P$ \smallcaps{or} $Q$ & $P \vee Q$ & \verb+P || Q+ & \verb+p or q+ \\
$P$ \smallcaps{xor} $Q$ & $P \oplus Q$ & \verb+p ^ q+ (bitwise) or \verb+p != q+ & \verb+p ^ q+ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For what values in Java or C are \verb+p ^ q+ and \verb+p != q+ both valid, but have different meanings?

## Logical Formulas

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
$P$ & \smallcaps{not}$(P)$ & \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \\ \hline
\T & \F & \\
\F & \T & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

How many one-input Boolean operators are there?  How many do we need to
produce them all?

#

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|c|c|c}
$P$ & $Q$ & $P \wedge Q$ & $P \vee Q$ & $P \implies Q$ & \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ & $P \oplus Q$ \\ \hline
\T & \T   & \T & \T & & \T & \F \\
\T & \F   &    & \T & & \F & \T \\
\F & \T   &    & \T & & \F & \T \\
\F & \F   &   & \F &  & \T & \F \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

How many two-input Boolean operators are there?

#

**De Morgan's Laws:** 
$$\neg(P \wedge Q) \equiv (\neg P) \vee (\neg Q)  \qquad \neg(P \vee Q) \equiv (\neg P) \wedge (\neg Q)$$

How can these be written without the $\neg$ in front?

##

Prove that it is possible to make all two-input Boolean operators using
just \smallcaps{not} and any _odd_ two-input operator. (An operator is _odd_,
if the number of outputs that are **True** are odd.)

##

**Definition: valid.** A logical formula is _valid_ if there is no way
  to make it **false**.  That is, no matter what truth values its
  variables have, it is always **true**.  (Another name for this is a
  _tautology_.)

**Definition: satisfiable.** A logical formula is _satisfiable_ if there
  is _some_ way to make it **true**.  That is, there is at least one
  assignment of truth value to its variables that makes the forumla
  true.

For each of the formulas below, determine if it is _valid_ and if it is _satisfiable_.

1. $(P \vee \neg P)$

2. $(P \vee Q) \wedge (\neg P \vee Q)$

3. $((P \implies Q) \wedge (Q \implies P)) \vee (P \xor Q)$

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A set is <em>well-ordered</em> with respect to an ordering
  function (e.g., &lt;), if all of its non-empty subsets has a minimum
  element.</p>

<p>What properties must a sensible ordering function have?</p>

<div class="gap"></div>

<p><strong>Trichotomy</strong>. A relation, $\prec$, satisfies the axiom of trichotomy
  if exactly one of these is true for all elements $a$ and $b$: $a \prec
  b$, $b \prec a$ or $a = b$.</p>

<p>Which of these are well-ordered?</p>

<ul>
<li>The set of non-negative integers, comparator $&lt;$.</li>
<li>The set of integers, comparator $&lt;$.</li>
<li>The set of integers, comparator $|a| &lt; |b|$.</li>
<li>The set of integers, comparator if |a| = |b|: $a &lt; b$, else: $|a| &lt; |b|$.</li>
<li>The set of national soccer teams, comparator winning games.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prove the set of positive rationals is <em>not</em> well-ordered under $&lt;$.</p>

<div class="gap"></div>

<p>#</p>

<p>Provide a comparison function that can be used to well-order the positive rationals.</p>

<h3 id="template-for-well-ordering-proofs-section-2-2">Template for Well-Ordering Proofs (Section 2.2)</h3>

<p>To prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define the set of counterexamples, $C ::= { n \in \mathbb{N} | NOT(P(n)) }$.</li>
<li>Assume for contradiction that $C$ is ______________. <!-- non-empty.--></li>
<li>By the well-ordering principle, there must be __________________ <!-- some smallest element-->, $m \in C$.</li>
<li>Reach a contradiction (this is the creative part!).  One way to reach a contradiction would be to show $P(m)$.  Another way is to show there must be an element $m&rsquo; \in C$ where $m&rsquo; &lt; m$.</li>
<li>Conclude that $C$ must be empty, hence there are no counter-examples and $P(n)$ always holds.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example: Betable Numbers.</strong> A number is <em>betable</em> if it can be
  produced using some combination of \$2 and \$5 chips.  Prove that all
  integer values greater than \$3 are betable.</p>

<div class="biggap"></div>

**Example: Division Property.** Given integer $a$ and positive integer $b$, there exist integers $q$ and $r$ such that:
      $a = qb + r$ and $0 \le r < b$.

    <p class="fronthead"><a href="https://uvacs2102.github.io/surveyquestions/">Survey Questions</a> (Sat, 27 Aug 2016)</p>
     <p>Here are my (in progress) responses to selected questions submitted in
the registration surveys.  I&rsquo;ll add more responses here as I go through
the rest of your questions.  If you have other questions after reading
this, feel free to ask them on slack (if you want it to be anonymous,
send it as a direct message and I&rsquo;ll answer it here).</p>

<p><div class="question">
I really hope that you (I&rsquo;m assuming I&rsquo;m talking to the Prof. Evans)
   regularly take a step back from the math we are doing and make an
   effort to explain how the things we are doing relate back to
   computing. In my opinion, this is what will really make the class
   interesting.<br />
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Yes, I&rsquo;ll definitely try and do this as much as I can.  Some of the
things we cover in this class have direct and immediate relevance to
computing, and I&rsquo;ll aim to point out in classes.  For deeper
understanding of the connections, especially when they are a bit less
direct as is the case for many topics, I think it is probably necessary
to do longer assignments that connect the abstract math concepts to
computing.  I&rsquo;m thinking about doing this some later in the course, but
also want to keep the assignments a reasonable length.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
How does the in class participation work? As in: how do you keep track of who participates?
   </div><div class="answer">
I&rsquo;m looking for &ldquo;class contribution&rdquo;, not just &ldquo;participation&rdquo;.  Class
contribution means you have done things to make the class better for
your classmates (as well as for me!).  This could be by answering or
asking questions in class, as well as on slack. It could also be by
bringing up interesting ideas or sharing relevant materials or news
items.  I&rsquo;m not keeping track of &ldquo;points&rdquo; for whenever someone does
something, and wouldn&rsquo;t want people to be contributing with &ldquo;getting a
point&rdquo; as the main motivation.  You should be contributing because you
want to get more out of the class yourself, and because you want to do
things to make the class experience better for everyone.  Even for a
largish class like this, over the course of the semester it is usually
clear which students have made the biggest contributions to the class,
and it will impact their grades favorably.  If you don&rsquo;t stand out as a
class contributor, it won&rsquo;t count against you (the common weighting for
class contribution in the final grade is 0%), but people who contribute
enough to stand out will be rewarded.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
Are there any good external resources/references that would aid me in this course?
   </div><div class="answer">
Yes, there are lots of resources that could be useful.</p>

<p>The most useful will be the MIT OpenCourseWare sites for the &ldquo;6.042:
Mathematics for Computer Science&rdquo; course:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm">Fall 2010 (Tom Leighton and Marten van Dijk)</a> (this includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB7540DEDD482705B">lecture videos</a>, mostly by Tom Leighton, which cover many of the topics in the course)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2010/">Spring 2010 (Albert Meyer)</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring16/class-material.shtml">Spring 2016 (Albert Meyer)</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find lots of examples and problems on these sites.</p>

<p>Another great (free) resource, but less directly matching what we do in
this course, is Richard Hammack&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/"><em>Book of
Proof</em></a>.</p>

<p></div></p>

<p><div class="question">
When AI does everything for us and there are few jobs will you become a Communist?
   </div><div class="answer">
This is a really good question, and something I&rsquo;ve occasionally talked
about (see <a href="http://rust-class.org/class-23-invent-the-future.html">Invent the
Future!</a> from my
OS class).  I don&rsquo;t think communism is the answer, but hope we&rsquo;ll get to
some kind of socialist utopia where everyone can have a high quality of
life (well above just subsistance) based on the abundant value that can
be created with automation, but there are opportunities for highly
creative or hard-working individuals to obtain excessive wealth (and
some privileges that go with this) by creating things that have great
benefit to millions or billions of people.</p>

<p></div></p>

<p><div class="question">
How did you get so interested in discrete math? It seems like a difficult subject to get in to.
   </div><div class="answer">
Most of my interest in the area stems from interest in cryptography and
its applications.  Cryptography is interesting and fun because its about
making and breaking puzzles; its important because it enables private
and secure transactions on open networks, and it changes power
relationships between individuals, organizations, and governments.
Nearly everything in cryptography today builds on concepts from discrete
mathematics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m teaching this course mostly because I like teaching foundational
courses and especially courses early in the curriculum, both for a first
chance to expose students to exciting new ideas and empowering students
more dramatically than can be done in later courses.  The other reasons
I wanted to teach cs2102 are becuase I&rsquo;ve already taught most of the
courses in our curriculum
(<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs200-spring2002/">cs200</a>/<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs150-fall2005/">cs150</a>/<a href="http://www.xplorecs.org/">cs1120</a>;
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101">cs101
(Udacity)</a>;
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs205-fall2006/">cs2220</a>;
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/">cs2150</a>;
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs3102-s10/">cs3102</a>; and
<a href="http://www.rust-class.org/">cs4414</a>) and like to teach new things since
I learn more by doing that, and this course seemed more likely to be a
good source of ideas for <a href="http://cvillemathcircle.org/">Cville Math
Circle</a> than the other core courses I
haven&rsquo;t taught yet.</p>

<p></div></p>

<p><div class="question">
Enjoyed your discussion of using &ldquo;hard math problems&rdquo; in todays encryption of for example the Bitcoin. Would love future discussions on the subject as it very much interests me.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Thanks!  I will try, but worry sometimes students find trangressions
like this confusing (or get worried about whether or not it is something
they need to know for an exam (which hopefully it will be clear when it
isn&rsquo;t).  If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about bitcoin, check out my <a href="bitcoin-class.org">CryptoCurrency Cabal</a> course from last year.
   </div></p>

<p><div class="question">
As I said above, I&rsquo;m very interested in cyber-security. Please do continue to frame lessons in applicable contexts. After all, I&rsquo;d love to inspired toward another summer project.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
 I&rsquo;d like to know more about data security.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
   Great!  I will keep trying to do this, but also need to limit how
   much time I spend on things too far outside the main course topics.
   If you&rsquo;re interested in the work my research group does in security
   and applied cryptography, see <a href="https://www
.jeffersonswheel.org">https://www.jeffersonswheel.org</a>.  I am happy to have excellent students join my research group, and anyone who does well in this class will be well-positioned for a summer position.</p>

<p></div>
   <div class="question">
What inspired you to join the field of Computer Science in the first place, and how important do you feel this course is to the overall field?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I had the good fortune to encounter computers when I was in second
grade. My school had a teletype machine with an acoustic coupler modem
(you would dial a phone to connect to the district&rsquo;s headquaters
computer and stick the phon into the coupler).  There was no display,
but it would print out interactions line-by-line.  The good news was
everything was just a BASIC program.  We started by playing the games,
but you could type <code>LIST</code> and see all the source code and read it to
learn how to &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; to win the game, and to start changing the code.
The next year, the school got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple
II</a>&rsquo;s, which were fantastic
machines with color graphics (that could display on a TV or monitor) and
even a disk drive that you could use to store programs!  It was so much fun to be able to play around with BASIC programs to draw on the screen, and eventually figure out how to handle key-presses to make games.</p>

<p>When I was in middle school, I sold my first program, which was a
program to keep track of team information for the wrestling coach.
Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t test it with more than 10 teammates, so when he
tried entering the team in it the program crashed when he got to the
11th person.</p>

<p>I knew programming computers was a lot of fun, but didn&rsquo;t know anything
about computer science (or that I wanted to do it for a career), until
taking Gerry Sussman&rsquo;s <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/">6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</a>
course (at MIT in 1989).  That opened me to the power and beauty of
computer science, beyond just writing programs, and I&rsquo;ve only had a few
digressions since.</p>

<p>As to why cs2102 (and the other theoretical and foundational courses you
take) is important, courses like these are the ones that should empower
you to envision and execute creative computing beyond standard practice.
There are tons of 3-month boot camps that can train most smart people to
become adequate web and mobile developers or data scientist programmers,
and people who complete these programs are able to find good six-figure
jobs.  The best of them will stay active in learning new APIs and tools,
and develop the experience needed to build increasingly complex
projects.  If you want to do that you don&rsquo;t need to do a four-year
degree at an expensive University like UVa &mdash; there are much
easier, faster, and cheaper career paths to being a professional
programmer.</p>

<p>On the other hand, people without fundamental understanding of the
underlying mathematics and theory of computing (which you should get
from cs2102, cs3102, and cs4102), and deep understanding of how
computing systems work (which you should get from cs2150, cs3330, and
cs4414), are unlikely to do things that really advance the state of
computing.  Most programmers do things that are unsurprising and
mundane; you should aspire to do things that are surprising and
<a href="http://www.clarkefoundation.org/about-sir-arthur/sir-arthurs-quotations/">indistinguishable from
magic</a>.</p>

<p>Although I hope cs2102 will be valuable and exciting on its own, its
real importance in the curriculum and your overall computing
development, is to prepare you well for cs3102 and cs4102.  As a whole,
though, the foundational understanding you should get from those courses
should enable you to design, build, and analyze computing systems that
do things people previously thought were not possible (or didn&rsquo;t even
think about at all!)<br />

<p>Sorry the proof in class got so messed up!  Although part of my goal for
class today was to illustrated the subjectiveness of human-written and
read proofs, I apologize for making things so confusing and broken.  I&rsquo;d
updated the notes to include the full proof (hopefully correct now!) at
the level of detail intended in class.  Its good to see students are
being skeptical proof-readers and noticing mistakes like this.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t get to the &ldquo;if and only if&rdquo; proof in the notes in class today,
but you are encouraged to try this on your own.  We&rsquo;ll look at this the

# Notes and Questions

An integer, $z$, is **even** if there exists an integer $k$ such that $z = 2k$.    

Is this a _definition_, _axiom_, or _proposition_?

#

An integer, $z$, is **odd** if there exists an integer $k$ such that $z
= 2k + 1$.  (Note that there is no connection between the variables used
here, and to define even above.)

To prove an implication, $P \implies Q$: 1. assume $P$.  2. Show chain of logical deductions that leads to $Q$.

**Odd-Even Lemma:** If an integer is not even, it is odd.  Note: A
  _lemma_ is just a name for a theorem, typically used for proving
  another theorem.

<p>How should one decide what can be accepted as an axiom, and what must be proven?</p>

<div class="gap"></div>

<p>What is the purpose of a <em>proof</em>?  (in cs2102? in software development? in algorithm design?)</p>

<div class="gap"></div>

<h2 id="proof-from-class">Proof from Class</h2>

<p>Proposition: If the product of $x$ and $y$ is even, at least one of $x$ or $y$ must be even.</p>

<p>Our goal is to prove the implication, $P \implies Q$, where:</p>

<ul>
<li>$P$ is &ldquo;the product of $x$ and $y$ is even&rdquo;</li>
<li>$Q$ is &ldquo;at least one of $x$ and $y$ must be even&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>We will prove the contrapositive.  The inference rule,</p>

<p>$$
\infer{P \implies Q}{NOT(Q) \implies NOT(P)}
$$
will be the last step in our proof.  To be able to use this rule, we need to make the antecedent true.  So, our goal is to prove $NOT(Q) \implies NOT(P)$.</p>

<p>To prove an implication, we assume the left side and short the right
side.  So, our proof begins:</p>

<ol>
<li>We prove the contrapositive.</li>
<li>Assume NOT(at least one of $x$ and $y$ must be even).</li>
<li>By the meaning of negation, this means both $x$ and $y$ are not even.</li>
<li>By the &ldquo;Odd-Even Lemma&rdquo;, both $x$ and $y$ are odd.</li>
<li>By the definition of <em>odd</em>, there exist integers $k$ and $m$ such that $x = 2k + 1$ and $y = 2m + 1$.</li>
<li>Substituting, $xy = (2k + 1)(2m + 1) = 4mk + 2m + 2k + 1 = 2(2mk + m + k) + 1$.</li>
<li>By the closure of addition and multiplication over the integers, there is some integer $r = 2mk + m + k$, so $xy = 2r + 1$.</li>
<li>By the definition of <em>odd</em>, $xy$ is odd.</li>
<li>By the (not proven) &ldquo;Even-Odd Lemma&rdquo;, this means $xy$ is not even.</li>
<li>So, we have shown NOT(the product of $x$ and $y$ is even).</li>
<li>Since we concluded this starting from the assumption (step 2), this proves the implication: NOT(at least one of $x$ and $y$ must be even) $\implies$ NOT(the product of $x$ and $y$ is even).</li>
<li>Using the contrapositive inference rule, we can conclude:
the product of $x$ and $y$ is even $\implies$ at least one of $x$ and $y$ must be even. \QEDA</li>
</ol>

<p>\dbox{
{\bf Challenge Problem Opportunity.} I wasn&rsquo;t very satisfied with my proof
  of the &ldquo;Odd-Even Lemma&rdquo; in class.  I hope a student will come up with
  a better proof.  A proof that passes the &ldquo;skeptical reader&rdquo; test and
  would convince someone with no prior knowledge of odd and even numbers
  is worth up to 10 bonus points.

<h2 id="proving-if-and-only-if">Proving &ldquo;If and Only If&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Strategy: To prove $P$ if and only if $Q$:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prove $P \implies Q$.</li>
<li>Prove $Q \implies P$.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Definition.</em> The <em>standard deviation</em> of a sequence of values $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ is
$$
\sqrt{\frac{(x_1 - \mu)^2 + (x_2 - \mu)^2 + \ldots + (x_n - \mu)^2}{n}}
$$
where $\mu$ is the mean of the values:
$$
\mu ::= \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n}{n}
$$.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 1.6.1.</strong> The standard deviation of a sequence of values, $x_1,
  x_2, \ldots, x_n$ is $0$ <em>if and only if</em> all of the $x_i$ values are
  equal to the mean of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$.</p>

<p>The book proves this using a chain of iff implications; prove it using
the two-implications strategy.</p>

### Notes and Questions

Why is most of the math used in computer science _discrete_?

<div class="gap"></div>

<p>Why is most of the math you have used in school previously <em>continuous</em>?</p>

<div class="gap"></div>

<p>What are the differences between how scientists, lawyers, and
mathematicians establish ``<em>truth</em>&rdquo;?</p>

<div class="gap"></div>

<p>A <em>proposition</em> is a statement that is either ________ or _________.</p>

<p>A <em>predicate</em> is a proposition whose truth may depend on the value of
variables.</p>

<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>

<p>A <em>theorem</em> is a ____________ that has been proven true.</p>

<p>An <em>axiom</em> is a proposition that is <em>accepted to be true</em>.  Axioms are
not proven; they are <em>assumed</em> to be true.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A <em>mathematical proof</em> of a proposition is a chain of
  <em>logical deductions</em> starting from a set of accepted <em>axioms</em> that
  leads to the proposition.</p>

<h3 id="rules-of-inference">Rules of Inference</h3>

<p>The possible steps that can be used in a proof are logical deductions
based on inference rules.</p>

<p>Inference rules are written as:
$$
\infer{\textrm{\emph{conclusion}}}{\textrm{\emph{antecedents}}}
$$
This means if everything on top of the rule is established to be true,
then you can conclude what is on the bottom.</p>

<p><em>Modus Ponens</em>: To prove <em>Q</em>, (1) prove <em>P</em> and (2) prove that <em>P</em> implies <em>Q</em>.  ($P \implies Q$ is a notation for $P$ implies $Q$).</p>

<p>$$
\infer{Q}{P,\quad P \implies Q}
$$</p>

<p>An inference rule is <em>sound</em> if can never lead to a <strong>false</strong> conclusion.</p>

<p>Which of these inference rules are sound?</p>

<p>$$
\infer{Q}{P}
\qquad
\infer{false}{P, P \implies Q}
\qquad
\infer{true}{P, NOT(P)}
\qquad
\infer{P \implies NOT(P)}{P, NOT(P)}
\qquad
\infer{NOT(Q) \implies P}{NOT(P) \implies Q}
$$</p>

<p>##</p>

<p><strong>Contrapositive:</strong></p>

<p>$$
\infer{NOT(Q) \implies NOT(P)}{P \implies Q}
\qquad
\infer{P \implies Q}{NOT(Q) \implies NOT(P)}
$$</p>

<p><strong>Theorem to Prove:</strong> If the product of $x$ and $y$ is even, at least one of $x$ or $y$ must be even.</p>
