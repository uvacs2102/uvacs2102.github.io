<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>

<p><a href="/ps/ps5"><strong>Problem Set 5</strong></a> is due <strong>Friday at 6:29pm</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday&rsquo;s Class</strong> may include review for Exam 1.  Before 6:59pm
  Wednesday, send <a href="mailto:uvacs2102staff@gmail.com"><em>uvacs2102staff@gmail.com</em></a> topics you would like to review:</p>

<ul>
<li>fewer than 10 total requests: class is not being sufficiently challenged and we should be doing more difficult material (except for the 10 requestors who get exam exemptions).<br /></li>
<li>exactly 10 total requests: all requestors get automatic exam exemptions, review requested topics.<br /></li>
<li>more than 10 requests implies we should spend Thursday’s class on reviewing requested topics, no exam exemptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exam-1">Exam 1</h3>

<p>Exam 1 will be in class on Thursday, 5 October.  You can get a good
idea what to expect on Exam 1 by looking at the <a href="/docs/practiceexam1.pdf">Practice Exam
1</a> (from last year&rsquo;s class). We strongly
encourage you to try to problems on your own, before looking at the
<a href="/docs/practiceexam1-solutions.pdf">posted solutions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Resources.</strong> You will be permitted to use a <em>single paper page</em> of
notes that you prepare and bring to the exam.  It is fine to
collaborate with others to prepare your notes.  The page should be no
larger than a US Letter size page ($8.5 \times 11$ inches), and you
may write (or print) on both sides of the page.  You may not use any
special devices (e.g., magnifying glasses) to read your page. No other
resources, other than your own brain, body, and writing instrument,
are permitted during the exam.</p>

<p><strong>Content.</strong> The problems on the exam will cover material from Classes
  1&ndash;11, Problem Sets 1&ndash;5 (including the provided solutions), and MCS
  Chapters 1&ndash;5.  Everything on the exam will be something you have seen
  in at least two of these (Classes, Problem Sets, and MCS Book), and
  most of the exam will be things you have seen in all three.  If you
  understand the problems on the problem sets and questions on the class
  notes well enough to be able to answer similar questions, you should
  do well on the exam.</p>

<p>The main topics the exam will cover include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Propositions, axioms, and proofs (you should understand what each of
these are and how to define them precisely)</p></li>

<li><p>Inference rules (how to determine and show if an inference rule is
sound or unsound, how to correctly use inference rules in a proof)</p></li>

<li><p>Logical formula (how to interpret logical formulas and convert English
statements into logic, determine the validity or satisfiability of a
formula, and show equivalence or non-equivalence of two formulas)</p></li>

<li><p>Logical quantifiers (how to reason about logical formula using
$\forall$ and $\exists$, including showing logical equivalence and
implication)</p></li>

<li><p>Proof methods (you should be able to read and write proofs that use
direct proof, contrapositive proof, and proof by contradiction)</p></li>

<li><p>Well ordering (you should be able to explain what it means for a set
to be well ordered, determine if a given set and operator is well
ordered, and be able to construct proofs using the well ordering
principle and identify flaws in misuses of the well ordering
principle)</p></li>

<li><p>Induction (you should understand mathematical induction and be able to
construct proofs using induction and identify flaws in misuses of
induction in proofs)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For most students, we believe the best way to prepare for the exam
will be to (1) go over the problem sets and their solutions, and make
sure you understand well any of the problems you did not get before;
(2) go through the provided practice exam and try to solve all the
problems on your own before reading the solutions; (3) go through the
questions in the class notes and convince yourself you can answer them
well; (4) re-read chapters of the book, solving the associated
practice problems, especially for any sections on topics where you had
difficulty on the problem sets.  If you do #1 and #2 and understand
well the problems on the practice exam, you should be confident you&rsquo;ll
do well on the exam; if you struggled on the problem sets, you would
benefit from doing #3 and #4 as well.</p>

<h2 id="total-and-partial-functions">Total and Partial Functions</h2>

<p>A <strong>function</strong> is a mathematical datatype that associates elements from
one set, called the <em>domain</em>, with elements from another set, called a
<em>codomain</em>.</p>

<p>$$ f: \textrm{\em domain} \rightarrow \textrm{\em codomain} $$</p>

<p>If the function is <em>total</em>, every element of the domain has one
associated codomain element; if the function is <em>partial</em>, there may be
elements of the domain that do not have an associated codomain element.</p>

<h2 id="relation-relationships">Relation Relationships</h2>

<p>Definition review: <strong>binary relation</strong>, $R$, consists of a domain set,
$A$, and a codomain set, $B$, and a subset of $A \times B$ called the
<em>graph</em> of $R$.</p>

<p>For each statement below, give the name and at least one example.</p>

<ul>
<li>A binary relation where no element of $A$ has more than one outgoing edge:</li>
</ul>

<p>##</p>

<ul>
<li>A binary relation where every element of $A$ has exactly one outgoing edge:</li>
</ul>

<p>##</p>

<ul>
<li>A binary relation where every element of $B$ has exactly one incoming edge:</li>
</ul>

<p>##</p>

<ul>
<li>A binary relation where every element of $A$ has exactly one outgoing
edge and every element of $B$ has exactly one incoming edge:</li>
</ul>

<p>##</p>

<p>If there exists a <em>bijective</em> relation between $S$ and $T$ defined by the graph $G$ which of these <em>must</em> be true:</p>

<p>a. there exists some <em>injective</em> relation between $S$ and $T$.
b. there exists some <em>bijective</em> relation between $T$ and $S$.
c. there exists a <em>total</em> function, $f: S \rightarrow T$.
d. $S - T = \emptyset$.
e. the number of elements of $S$ is equal to the number of elements of $T$.
f. $G - (S \times T) = \emptyset$.
g. $(S \times T) - G = \emptyset$.
h. $(S \times T) - G \neq \emptyset$.</p>

<h1 id="relation-practice">Relation Practice</h1>

<p>The <em>inverse</em> of a relation $R: A \rightarrow B, G \subseteq A \times B$ is defined by reversing all the arrows:
$$
R^{-1}: B \rightarrow A, G^{-1} \subseteq B \times A
$$</p>

<p>$$
(b, a) \in G^{-1} \iff \fillin\fillin\fillin\fillin
$$</p>

<p>What does it mean if $R \equiv R^{-1}$?</p>

<h1 id="set-cardinality">Set Cardinality</h1>

<p><strong>Finite Cardinality.</strong> The book&rsquo;s definition is: ``If $A$ is a finite set, the <em>cardinality</em> of
  $A$, written $|A|$, is the number of elements in $A$.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Does this definition require adding a new fundamental set operation,
or is it meaningful with just the set operations we have defined?</p>

<p><strong>Alternate definition:</strong> The <em>cardinality</em> of the set $$ N_k = { n |
n \in \mathbb{N} \wedge n &lt; k } $$ is $k$. (Next class, we&rsquo;ll use
this to define the <em>cardinality</em> of any set. You should be able to
figure out how to do this on your own with what you know now.)</p>

<h1 id="sequences">Sequences</h1>

<p>A <strong>sequence</strong> is a mathematical datatype that bears similarities to sets. A sequence $S$ also contains some elements, but we usually refer to them as <em>components</em>. There are two major differences between sets and sequences:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Components of a sequence are <strong>ordered</strong>. There is either $0$, or $1$ or $2$, or &hellip; $n$ components, when the sequence if <em>finite</em> or it could be an infinite sequence that has an $i$&lsquo;th component for any non-zero natural number $i$.</p></li>

<li><p>Different components of a sequence could be equal. For example $(a,b,a)$ has $a$ repeating, and this is a different sequence compared to $(a,b,b)$ even though they both have 3 componetns. If we interprete them as <em>sets</em>, then they will be equal sets with $2$ elements each.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="cartesian-product">Cartesian Product</h1>

<p>We can use set products to get new sets whose elements are sequences. Cartesian product is a very useful way of doing it.</p>

<p><strong>Set Products.</strong> A <em>Cartesian product</em> of sets $S_1, S_2, \cdots, S_n$
  is a set consisting of all possible sequences of $n$ elements where the
  $i$\textsuperscript{th} element is chosen from $S_i$.</p>

<p>$$ S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n = { (s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n) | s_i \in S_i } $$</p>

<p>How many elements are in $A \times B$?</p>

<h1 id="relations-and-binary-relations">Relations and Binary Relations</h1>

<p>A <em>relation</em> between some elements from set $A$ and some elements from set $B$ could be represented by putting all such pairs $(a,b)$ in a set $P$. As you can see, this way, $P$ would be a subset of the cartesian product $A \times B$, namely $P \subseteq A \times B$. More formally we have the following definition.</p>

<p>A <strong>binary relation</strong>, $P$, is defined with respect to a <em>domain</em> set, $A$, and a
<em>codomain</em> set, $B$, and it holds that  $P$ is $P \subseteq A \times B$. When we draw $P$ by connecting elements of $A$ to $B$ based on their membership in $P$, we call this  the <em>graph</em> of
$R$.</p>

<p>The notion of relations could be generalized to having relations
between elements coming from multiple sets $A,B,C$, and we can also
talk about relations of the form $P \subseteq A \times B \times C$,
but the binary relation remains a very important data type as it
allows us to define <em>functions</em>.</p>

<h1 id="functions">Functions</h1>

<p>The concept of a function $F$ models is a special form of a binary
relation $R$ between $A$ and $B$ where for every element $a \in A$
there is <em>at most one</em> element in $b \in B$ that is in relation with
$a$ (i.e. $(a,b) \in R$). More formally, we use a direct new notation
just reserved for working with functions.</p>

<p>A <strong>function</strong> is a mathematical datatype that associates
elements from one set, called the <em>domain</em>, with elements from another
set, called a <em>codomain</em>.</p>

<p>$$ f: \textrm{\em domain} \rightarrow \textrm{\em codomain} $$</p>

<p><strong>Defining a function.</strong> To define a function, we need to describe how
  elements in the domain are associated with elements in the codomain.</p>

<p>#</p>

<p>What are the (sensible) domains and codomains of each function below:</p>

<p>$$ f(n) ::= |n| \qquad \qquad f(x) ::= x^2  \qquad\qquad f(n) ::= n + 1 \qquad\qquad f(a, b) ::= a / b $$</p>

<p>$$ f(x) ::= \sqrt{x}  \qquad \qquad \qquad f(S) ::= \textrm{minimum}_{&lt;}(S) $$</p>

<p>What is a <em>data type</em>?  What are the differences between a <em>mathematical
data type</em> and a data type in your favorite programming language?</p>

<p>#</p>

<p>A <strong>set</strong> is an unordered colection of objects.  A set is defined by its
membership operation: $x \in S$ is true if $x$ is in the set $S$. When $x$ is not in $S$ we write it as $x \notin S$. A set has only <em>one</em> copy of each element. Namely, there is no repetition in elements of a set. Also, a set $A$ could be a member o another set $B$, denoted by $A \in B$. Note that members of $A$ are not necessarily members of $B$ unless they are explicitly put in $B$ directly.</p>

<h2 id="set-operations">Set Operations</h2>

<p>Subset: $\subseteq$ (note that this does not mean <em>strict subset</em>)
$$A \subseteq B \iff \forall x \in A. \fillin \in \fillin.$$</p>

<p>Set Equality: $=$
$$A = B \iff A \fillin B \wedge B \fillin A.$$</p>

<p>Set Union: $\cup$
$$\forall x. x \in A \cup B \iff x \in A \fillin x \in B.$$</p>

<p>Set Intersection: $\cap$
$$\forall x. x \in A \cap B \iff x \in A \fillin x \in B.$$</p>

<p>Set Difference: $-$
$$\forall x. x \in A - B \iff x \in A \wedge x \notin B.$$</p>

<p>Set Complement: $\overline{S}$
$$ \forall  x \in D. x \in \overline{A} \iff x \notin A.$$</p>

<p>($D$ is the ``domain of discourse&rdquo;, the universe of all objects under
discussion.)</p>

<h3 id="russell-s-paradox">Russell&rsquo;s Paradox</h3>

<p>$$ S_{R} = \textrm{ the set of all sets that are not members of themselves} $$</p>

<p>Is $S<em>{R} \in S</em>{R}$?</p>

<p>What is the source of this paradox? Note that in this question, we are implicitly assuming that $S<em>{R}$ is a set, but we have never &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; this set properly to use it. Namely, here we are implicitly assuming that there is already a &ldquo;set of all sets&rdquo; $S</em>{all}$ from which we remove those sets like $T$ for which $T \in T$. By removing all such $T$ from $S_{all}$ we get the set $S_R$.</p>

<h3 id="using-quantifiers-more-carefully">Using Quantifiers More Carefully</h3>

<p>Note that in some of the  propositions that we used to define the set operations (such as union, intersection, etc.) above, we wrote quantified $x$ without saying which set it is from. For example  $\forall x. [\dots]$. It is much preferred to always say what $x$ is belonging to when we quantify over $x$. The reason is to avoid traps like that of Russell&rsquo;s paradox! This should not worry us in this class, as we will always work with well-defined <em>universes</em> that include all the elements of the sets that we work with. Therefore, we can always assume implicitly that $x \in U$ (for a well defined set universe $U$) even if not explicitly mentioned.</p>

<p>#</p>

<h3 id="set-practice">Set Practice</h3>

<p>Here are some practice problems involving sets.  We won&rsquo;t go through
these in class, but you should ask questions about any are unclear.  (At
least a few of these will be on Exam 1.)</p>

<ol>
<li>Define $A \subset B$ (strict subset).</li>
</ol>

<p>#</p>

<ol>
<li>Prove $A \cup B \equiv B \cup A$.</li>
</ol>

<p>#</p>

<ol>
<li>Prove $A - B = \emptyset \iff A \subseteq B$.</li>
</ol>

<p>#</p>

<ol>
<li>Prove $A = B \iff (\forall a \in A \ldotp a \in B) \wedge (\forall b \in B \ldotp b \in A).$
</div></li>
</ol>
