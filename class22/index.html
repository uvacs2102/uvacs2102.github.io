<h2 id="excerpt">Excerpt</h2>

<p>G. H. Hardy, <a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss/misc/A%20Mathematician's%20Apology.pdf"><em>A Mathematician&rsquo;s Apology</em></a>, 1940.</p>

<p><blockquote>
A man <font color="gray">(sic - Hardy&rsquo;s quote, unfortunately, but typical for 1940, uses <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html">sexist language</a> throughout, but I will leave it as written, but &ldquo;man&rdquo; here means &ldquo;person&rdquo;, and &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; are not meant to be limited to males)</font> who sets out to justify his existence and his activities
has to distinguish two different questions. The first is whether the
work which he does is worth doing; and the second is why he does it,
whatever its value may be. The first question is often very difficult,
and the answer very discouraging, but most people will find the second
easy enough even then. Their answers, if they are honest, will usually
take one or other of two forms; and the second form is a merely a
humbler variation of the first, which is the only answer we need
consider seriously.</p>

<p>(1) ‘I do what I do because it is the one and only thing that I
can do at all well. I am a lawyer, or a stockbroker, or a professional
cricketer, because I have some real talent for that particular
job. I am a lawyer because I have a fluent tongue, and am
interested in legal subtleties; I am a stockbroker because my
judgment of the markets is quick and sound; I am a professional
cricketer because I can bat unusually well. I agree that it might be
better to be a poet or a mathematician, but unfortunately I have no
talent for such pursuits.’</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that this is a defence which can be made
by most people, since most people can do nothing at all well. But
it is impregnable when it can be made without absurdity, as it can
by a substantial minority: perhaps five or even ten percent of men
can do something rather well. It is a tiny minority who can do
something really well, and the number of men who can do two
things well is negligible. If a man has any genuine talent he
should be ready to make almost any sacrifice in order to cultivate
it to the full.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>There is also what I call the ‘humbler variation’ of the standard
apology; but I may dismiss this in a very few words.</p>

<p>(2) ‘There is nothing that I can do particularly well. I do what I
do because it came my way. I really never had a chance of doing
anything else.’ And this apology too I accept as conclusive. It is
quite true that most people can do nothing well. If so, it matters
very little what career they choose, and there is really nothing
more to say about it. It is a conclusive reply, but hardly one likely
to be made by a man with any pride; and I may assume that none
of us would be content with it.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>A man’s first duty, a young man’s at any rate, is to be
ambitious. Ambition is a noble passion which may legitimately take
many forms; there was something noble in the ambitions of Attila or
Napoleon; but the noblest ambition is that of leaving behind something
of permanent value &mdash;
&hellip;</p>

<p>There are many highly respected motives which may lead men
to prosecute research, but three which are much more important
than the rest. The first (without which the rest must come to
nothing) is intellectual curiosity, desire to know the truth. Then,
professional pride, anxiety to be satisfied with one’s performance,
the shame that overcomes any self-respecting craftsman when his
work is unworthy of his talent. Finally, ambition, desire for
reputation, and the position, even the power or the money, which
it brings. It may be fine to feel, when you have done your work,
that you have added to the happiness or alleviated the sufferings
of others, but that will not be why you did it. So if a mathematician,
or a chemist, or even a physiologist, were to tell me that the
driving force in his work had been the desired to benefit
humanity, then I should not believe him (nor should I think the
better of him if I did). His dominant motives have been those
which I have stated, and in which, surely, there is nothing of
which any decent man need be ashamed.</p>

<p>If intellectual curiosity, professional pride, and ambition are the
dominant incentives to research, then assuredly no one has a
fairer chance of satisfying them than a mathematician. His subject
is the most curious of all—there is none in which truth plays such
odd pranks. It has the most elaborate and the most fascinating
technique, and gives unrivalled openings for the display of sheer
professional skill. Finally, as history proves abundantly,
mathematical achievement, whatever its intrinsic worth, is the
most enduring of all.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.  If
his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are
made with <em>ideas</em>. &hellip; The mathematician’s patterns, like the
painter&rsquo;s or the poet&rsquo;s must be beautiful; the ideas like the colours
or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the
first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly
mathematics.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>The fact is that there are few more ‘popular’ subjects than
mathematics. Most people have some appreciation of mathematics,
just as most people can enjoy a pleasant tune; and there are
probably more people really interested in mathematics than in
music. Appearances suggest the contrary, but there are easy
explanations. Music can be used to stimulate mass emotion, while
mathematics cannot; and musical incapacity is recognized (no
doubt rightly) as mildly discreditable, whereas most people are so
frightened of the name of mathematics that they are ready, quite
unaffectedly, to exaggerate their own mathematical stupidity.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>It is undeniable that a good deal of
elementary mathematics—and I use the word ‘elementary’ in the
sense in which professional mathematicians use it, in which it
includes, for example, a fair working knowledge of the differential
and integral calculus—has considerable practical utility.
These parts of mathematics are, on the whole, rather dull; they are
just the parts which have the least aesthetic value. The ‘real’
mathematics of the ‘real’ mathematicians, the mathematics of
Fermat and Euler and Gauss and Abel and Riemann, is almost
wholly ‘useless’ (and this is as true of ‘applied’ as of ‘pure’
mathematics). It is not possible to justify the life of any genuine
professional mathematician on the ground of the ‘utility’ of his
work.</p>

<p>But here I must deal with a misconception. It is sometimes suggested
that pure mathematicians glory in the uselessness of their work, and
make it a boast that it has no practical applications.  The imputation
is usually based on an incautious saying attributed to Gauss, to the
effect that, if mathematics is the queen of the sciences, then the
theory of numbers is, because of its supreme uselessness, the queen of
mathematics—I have never been able to find an exact quotation. I am
sure that Gauss’s saying (if indeed it be his) has been rather crudely
misinterpreted.  If the theory of numbers could be employed for any
practical and obviously honourable purpose, if it could be turned
directly to the furtherance of human happiness or the relief of human
suffering, as physiology and even chemistry can, then surely neither
Gauss nor any other mathematician would have been so foolish as to
decry or regret such applications. <b>But science works for evil as well
as for good (and particularly, of course, in time of war); and both
Gauss and less mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there
is one science at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness
from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle and clean.</b></p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>We have concluded that the trivial mathematics is, on the whole,
useful, and that the real mathematics, on the whole, is not; that the
trivial mathematics does, and the real mathematics does not, ‘do good’
in a certain sense; but we have still to ask whether either sort of
mathematics does harm. It would be paradoxical to suggest that
mathematics of any sort does much harm in time of peace, so that we
are driven to the consideration of the effects of mathematics
on war. It is every difficult to argue such questions at all
dispassionately now, and I should have preferred to avoid them;
but some sort of discussion seems inevitable. Fortunately, it need
not be a long one.</p>

<p><b>There is one comforting conclusions which is easy for a real
mathematician. Real mathematics has no effects on war. No one has yet
discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers
or relativity, and it seems very unlikely that anyone will do so for
many years.</b> It is true that there are branches of applied
mathematics, such as ballistics and aerodynamics, which have been
developed deliberately for war and demand a quite elaborate technique:
it is perhaps hard to call them ‘trivial’, but none of them has any
claim to rank as ‘real’. They are indeed repulsively ugly and
intolerably dull; even Littlewood could not make ballistics
respectable, and if he could not who can? So a real mathematician has
his conscience clear; there is nothing to be set against any value his
work may have; mathematics is, as I said at Oxford, a ‘harmless and
innocent’ occupation.</p>

<p>The trivial mathematics, on the other hand, has many applications
in war. The gunnery experts and aeroplane designers, for
example, could not do their work without it. And the general
effect of these applications is plain: mathematics facilitates (if not
so obviously as physics or chemistry) modern, scientific, ‘total’
war.</p>

<p>It is not so clear as it might seem that this is to be regretted,
since there are two sharply contrasted views about modern scientific
war. The first and the most obvious is that the effect of science on
war is merely to magnify its horror, both by increasing the sufferings
of the minority who have to fight and by extending them to other
classes. This is the most natural and orthodox view.  But there is a
very different view which seems also quite tenable, and which has been
stated with great force by Haldane in <em>Callinicus</em>. It can be
maintained that modern warfare is less horrible than the warfare of
pre-scientific times; that bombs are probably more merciful than
bayonets; that lachrymatory gas and mustard gas are perhaps the most
humane weapons yet devised by military science; and that the orthodox
view rests solely on loos-thinking sentimentalism. It may also by
urged (though this was not one of Haldane’s theses) that the
equalization of risks which science was expected to bring would be in
the long range salutary; that a civilian’s life is not worth more than
a soldier’s, nor a woman’s more than a man’s; that anything is better
than the concentration of savagery on one particular class; and that,
in short, the sooner war comes ‘all out’ the better.</p>

<p>I do not know which of these views is nearer to the truth. It is
an urgent and a moving question, but I need not argue it here. It
concerns only the ‘trivial’ mathematics, which it would be
Hogben’s business to defend rather than mine. The cases for his
mathematics may be rather more than a little soiled; the case for
mine is unaffected.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is more to be said, since there is one purpose at any
rate which the real mathematics may serve in war. When the world is
mad, a mathematician may find in mathematics an incomparable anodyne.
